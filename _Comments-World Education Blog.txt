Thank you. Most of these young people tend to find employment in high-risk industries . Most workplace accidents happen within the first twelve months of employment; poor communications and human factors i.e., loss of attention, play a role in a significantly high number of all workplace accidents and there are particularly vulnerable groups. Despite numerous intervention and prevention strategies, these ILO statistics were forecast to increase before the pandemic. I can&#8217;t imagine what the new forecast will look like. We know that very significant numbers of people, especially vulnerable groups, with very low levels of literacy and learning ability and no previous occupational Safety and Health (OSH) literacy education, are entering into dangerous and exploitative employment and training environments. There needs to be much more awareness of this issue and collaboration between stakeholders to embed osh into education-to-employment ecosystems or the numbers of workplace deaths, diseases injuries and losses will skyrocket.

After that it is important that if it is necessary for them to change to a less familiar language of learning, this transfer is managed  carefully in a multilingual classroom. These are fundamental principles of language in education, especially in the global south.

Accountability has to be increased and developed for international organisations as well. Currently, nothing is done for this and you cannot keep blaming only the governments.

Organizing youth forums, and involving civil society is often just an operation communication. On the field, they have little powers over government and even less over international organisations who remains accountable to &#8230; themselves. This is for the critics.

This is coupled with \\u201cmuch less\\u201d kind, stable, (very little kind verbal interaction) and much less mental\\/emotional support, knowledge, and skills for fear of coddling. It is this more aggressive, less supportive treatment, which creates the toughness or extra maintained layers of average stress: anger, fear, preparation for defense, anxiety, etc.  These layers remain in the mind and take away real mental energy from academics, so those boys will have to work two or three times as hard to receive the same mental reward for mental work expended.<br \\/>\\nThis aggressive, less supportive treatment along with less verbal interaction creates more social\\/emotional distance\\/distrust of others \\u2013 parents, teachers, peers, and others in society. It creates much less social vocabulary, knowledge of syntax and other communication we as girls are given on a continual basis from infancy.  I feel this much less interaction also deprives boys, later men of many more areas of knowledge and skills girls are given through much more continual interaction and support\\/communication from everyone.  Worse, this more aggressive and less supportive treatment leads to even more, sustained weights and values of more distance and even less social development over time while girls, later women who are given much kind, caring, verbal interaction\\/support continue are able to develop and use more and more social vocabulary and much more knowledge over time.  From this treatment, I feel boys effectively understand about a third of the communication they have with parents, teachers, and other adults.  The higher average stress creates more activity for stress relief (not genetics environmentally created).<br \\/>\\nThe total effect including less care and support creates much more failure and a feeling of hopelessness, especially with our false genetic models firmly in place.  Also to make it even tougher for boys is the granting of love and honor (feelings of self-worth) only on condition of achievement, status, or image.  This was designed to keep Male esteem and feelings of self-worth low to keep them striving and be willing to give their lives in war for small measures of love and honor from society.  Males not achieving in school or other areas are given more ridicule and discipline to make them try harder.  Support is not given boys for fear of coddling and the false genetic models.  Many boys (as you would expect) thus falling behind in school then turn their attention to sports and video games to gleam small measures of love and honor not received in the classroom.  The belief boys should be strong and the false belief in genetics creates a blatant mental denial of the differential treatment, which is creating the lower academics, low esteem, and other problems many boys are facing today.  So strong is the belief boys should be strong there is an almost emotional cannibalism allowed upon boys and men who appear weak in some way by society: parents, teachers, others, even from many girls and women, especially in the media.<br \\/>\\n\\tNote, this is not about showing feelings or openness from boys and men, it is about support, care, and respect for boys even when appearing weak in some way.  Remember aggressive treatment is increased for any sign of weakness and so boys have much wariness for parents and teachers who feel it necessary and are more freely allowed to use more aggressiveness for any sign of weakness or vulnerability.  This is condoned by many in society today.<br \\/>\\n\\tAs for reading, we need high social vocabulary, much social\\/verbal interaction experience with sentence structure and \\u201clower average stress\\u201d to perform and enjoy the abstract skills of reading: decoding, visualizing, organizing, reaching into their social vocabulary\\/knowledge of words to learn new words in print, and enjoy the process. Boys are deprived in these areas due to much less care, verbal interaction, and much more aggressive treatment.  As for writing, we also need much social vocabulary to understand, plan, and to put words into print.  We also need lower average stress to create more ease of writing. The higher average stress creates significant higher muscle tension, which then creates a much tighter grip and more pressure on their pen or pencil.  This creates poor handwriting and early fatigue.  This kills off their motivation to write, hence more two and three word sentences from boys with and less motivation.<br \\/>\\n\\tI feel the shows of masculinity and misbehavior are pretty much cop outs to both show separation from failure and also to generate small measures of love and honor from their peers.  Their defensiveness from authority is really pretty straight forward, especially in lower socioeconomic areas where strength, power, and status hold very real currency in those areas. For those students it is not just misbehavior but a real tug of war or fight for minimum feelings of self-worth from a continual fight they feel outside the classroom as well as in.<br \\/>\\n\\tThe suicide epidemic for boys and men is the result of Males being deprived sufficiently from essential feelings of self-worth and so being denied love and honor from others.  The more aggressive, less supportive treatment boys are given from an early age is creating much more failure and hopelessness in school, preventing many boys, later men from competing in the information age thus losing the means to secure legally, income, status, and power to earn love and honor from society.  This then creates many more instances of more aggressive, less respectful treatment, which slowly wears down their feelings of self-worth or desire to live right on to the point of suicide.  I feel long before this point is reached, many many more boys and men are already escaping in various harmful ways from video games and sports to drug\\/alcohol abuse in an attempt to live despite the low feelings of self-worth they are feeling.<br \\/>\\n\\tThere is a wrinkle to this. There are a &#8220;very few boys&#8221; given more stable, correct support from a few families which is enabling those few boys to succeed in school.  This enables those boys to do well in school and receive love and honor from others, which they must continually keep doing to keep earning love and honor from society.  This then becomes a never-ending drug for those boys which drives them to continually achieve in school.  Those very few boys will be driven to continually achieve both in school and society with much more success due to the drug of achievement to earn love and honor.  However the vast majority of those boys receiving very little support and much more aggressive treatment will not do well in school. Early on, they go into other areas to generate love and honor such as escaping to sports and video games, later to the military, (far right groups), or other areas just to generate ounces of love\\/honor from others.  I feel the rapidly growing far right groups today are rooted in the hopelessness; anger; misled, inner feelings of inferiority to women; and the yes, now accumulating layers of abuse society and sadly many women are giving many boys and men today due to false feelings of superiority.<br \\/>\\n\\tSadly, indulgence pays in the information age, while less supportive, more aggressive treatment hurts development in the information age.  As girls we are treated much better and enjoy much more hope and care from society. Since we as girls are given by differential treatment, much more continual, positive \\u2013 mental, social, emotional support, verbal interaction from an early age onward, this creates quite the opposite outcome for girls when compared with the boys.  The much more verbal interaction also transfers and creates many small and large arrays of real knowledge and skills, which are \\u201cimportant for learning, communication, and working with knowledge and skills\\u201d.  I feel this is creating a significant advantage for girls and women. We enjoy much more care and support from society, from infancy through adulthood and receive love and honor simply for being girls. This creates all of the good things.  This is even so for lower socioeconomic environments, where even here, girls, later women are able to perform very well in school and society due to much better continual support from everyone.  We enjoy lower average stress for more ease of learning. We enjoy much more freedom of expression from much protection that makes us look more unstable at times. Of course we can also use that same tremendous freedom of expression to give verbal, silent abuse, and hollow kindness\\/patronization to our Male peers with impunity knowing we are protected.  We enjoy much lower muscle tension for more ease and ability in handwriting and motivation to write. We enjoy much more positive, trust\\/communication from parents, teachers, peers, and more support for perceived weaknesses. We are reaping a bonanza in the information age. The lower the socioeconomic bracket the much more amplified the differential treatment from infancy and more differentiated over time through adulthood. Now with girls and women taking over many areas of society, we are enjoying even more lavishing of love and honor from society, while the boys and men are now failing more so and are now given even more ridicule and abuse by society.  Much more on this.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2022\\/04\\/07\\/education-increasingly-becomes-a-boys-problem-at-high-cost\\/#comment-51055","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5425162d0b4d89bd8ebd72368413a53e?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5425162d0b4d89bd8ebd72368413a53e?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5425162d0b4d89bd8ebd72368413a53e?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5425162d0b4d89bd8ebd72368413a53e?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/51055"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/29432"}]}},{"id":51049,"post":30020,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"ABHIMANYU SINGH","author_url":"","date":"2022-06-02T16:26:13","date_gmt":"2022-06-02T14:26:13","content":{"rendered":"<p>Compliments on a good piece recalling the challenges of launching the GMR in 2002.

Happy Anniversary to UNEVOC-UNESCO.<\\/p>\\n<p>Firstly, I must state that the style hereby is as a review for a journal article, on relevant areas. It is my first time working on a blog.<\\/p>\\n<p>Introduction<\\/p>\\n<p>Here in Ethiopia, we have a mini blackout since the WiFi outlet is turned off overnight. My mobile data is very limited too and I have not familiarised myself fully as to how to customize the optimisation of my mobile data\\/credit. Such limitations can not always define sectors since social class as a state of mind, work ethic, Organisation Behaviour can demarket various sectors. For instance, the engagement of the staff, team work directive and appraisal policy as taskforce can be down to socioeconomic group, often indicated by educational attainment and this defines social class and the class struggle thereof.<\\/p>\\n<p>This can be stating the obvious, yet, the main premise hereby is that demarkation between government, non government and private sector can be the right categorisation and, of course, there is difficulty to demarket them as clear cut entities. But organisation behaviour, change, reform and development does reshape reality in the short and long run. For instance, in tuition fee paying UK Universities, their brand can be catahorised as having charitable status. Charities can also function within such establishmemts. The state is the government so to speak and your blog post seemed to demystify the myth but the categorisation need to be these three sectors and their subsets, without sidelining individual experts. The pitfall of hybridization is that muktiagency and multistakeholder work can lack being joint-up, of equal footing nature, multicultural and multidisciplinary. Yet, goal 17 of the SDG dictates the fact that partnetship for the goals is quintessential. We do somehow need to collaborate, as knowledge transfer partners, to say the least. Strong Institutions is another goal of the SDG and coming together as one and delivering as one, as the motto of the United Nations dictate is important.<\\/p>\\n<p>Eduaction, Myth and It&#8217;s Expansive Usage during the Digital Era<\\/p>\\n<p>Beforehand, I was listening to current affairs, specifically, the briefing of the Committee on the Second Homecoming, which culminates along with the completion of the Hajji pilgrimage of year 2022, and this Ethiopian movement is labelled as &#8220;Eid to Eid&#8221;. The first round was for Christians earlier on during this year.<\\/p>\\n<p>Normally, it is unlike me to read further, for the sake of enlightenment, in Wikipidia, about some Islamic terms, yet I did anyway. More often than not, I prefer the credibility of other encyclopedias. Surprisingly, the references thereby, including various Islam Encyclopedias are rich for the &#8220;Esoteric meaning of Islam&#8221; and related links, including the two unknown letters on Kuran, which is the holy script. It is intriguing becuase the literal meaning of such words or the book, even the Koran states, are concealed. Yet, during this Eid Mubarak season known as the Ramadan Kareem fasting, many are upholding the fact that the Koran is conceived and then inked. The Pen, as the leader Mohamed the Prophet proclaimed, is the most important creation. There is a Surat, which I believe means chapter, in the daily edited Wikipidia which can wipe out a section, about The Pen. Perhaps I have failed to understand this part for esotoric ideals are mystical, to me anyway.<\\/p>\\n<p>On another level, it is head knowledge that for Christianity that this kind of &#8220;passive interest&#8221;, let alone a full blown inclination, can often be dubbed as a wrongful immersion in Myth, which is short for Mythology. But people watch Dan Brown movies and do read books on such genre anyway and the myth buster for such &#8220;myth&#8221;, some being filmed in the Vatican is usually found in the internet.<\\/p>\\n<p>Global Education Monitoring and The Myths Thereof<\\/p>\\n<p>Ironically, the Global Education Monitoring Report lists so many myths and one of them is discussed hereby. It is freedom in a way to read about myth since Occult and Esotoric ideals, whether dubbed as Myth, metaphysical or mystical,to be mocked or downplayed or even labelled as hearsay, do interest me and several others. But I do not have free time to fully explore their Historiography. As already mentioned, the references in Wikipidia are unbelievably from the high end, including Academic Press from Routeledge but be mindful that new editors may extinct such species assuming the daredevil stance.<\\/p>\\n<p>The premise of the blog is about myth so that believing that a sector is clear cut is not to be the normality and formality. That is an  enrichment to Organisation Behaviour as a discpline. Social class, I argue, definrs or demarks private and public education run as bottom up policy or parents&#8217; expert leadership within or independent of education establishments, perhaps with clusterised teams, norming their ideas whilist others ajourn to find their niche market. Classism can not be the case to be a claimed hereby since the University of Leicester in Britisn had also a slogan, or more of a promotion of the brand, which reads as &#8220;Elite without being Elitist&#8221;.<\\/p>\\n<p>After all, the SDG on Education is not about politics at British school gate by the so-called yummy mums in happy wedlocks, non streamlined dress sence, swaying hips, outspokenness leading to informality and coercion at school gates which form such pseudo teams that run sleepovers that falter to allow us to learn about their belief systems, yet, with hypocracy, they can shun Halloween school parties which have &#8220;fun and disco&#8221; as the main themes. There is more. School governance and leadership at teritary level has to erradicate such intricacies in informal networks and mainstreaming emotional intelligence as such. Some argue that intelligence quotient is irrelevant, so streamlining, formality and virtues can not be sidelined as dogma. They are pillars to emotional intelligence and independent education. More so, enterprenerial skills can be upheld for the SDG only through valuing partnership or creativity for the higher good. The avalanche of techology and service realted innovative stance needs to be monitored during the fourth industrial revolution.<\\/p>\\n<p>Leaving the monitised agglomeration aside, no one should pay for the aforementioned behaviours one way or another unless it is their innate pathway. This is not the Montisorri Way. Overall, emotional intelligence and opportunity cost of time have value. Who walks the talk? For Whoes Interest? The whole picture can be different should this be labeled as formalised organisational partnership since hierarchy, some sidelining or silencing expertise, and the competition thereof, would have been entertained as professionalism which creates another circuit for membership or service delivery payment, as privatisation, or academisation to borrow the British term. Innovation, is the mantra of this era and those who question it are the trouble makers or are obsessed with critique. So, in a world whereby the Big Pharma and Corporate Giants play their games, Education is also branding into &#8220;privatisation&#8221;, indeed, with the illusion of delivering, since repression of leadership with diversity at heart gives way to a default position assumed by some who lack knowledge in ethics, equity and emotional intelligence. This fosters Neocolonialism further afield.<\\/p>\\n<p>Again Have a Jappy Twentieth Anniversary to UNEVOC-UNESCO<\\/p>\\n<p>Cordially,<\\/p>\\n<p>Lul Admadachew<br \\/>\\n<a href=\\"mailto:instituteforhealthservices@gmail.com\\">instituteforhealthservices@gmail.com<\\/a><\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2022\\/01\\/05\\/it-is-time-to-break-the-myth-that-state-and-non-state-actors-can-be-clearly-distinguished\\/#comment-50970","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/29250e4dad498819a9d693428e4431ad?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/29250e4dad498819a9d693428e4431ad?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/29250e4dad498819a9d693428e4431ad?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/29250e4dad498819a9d693428e4431ad?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/50970"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/14968"}]}},{"id":50964,"post":29240,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"MeridiE","author_url":"http:\\/\\/varlyproject.wordpress.com","date":"2022-03-30T11:41:51","date_gmt":"2022-03-30T09:41:51","content":{"rendered":"<p>the infamous TIANA, there is no alternative<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2022\\/03\\/30\\/making-all-schools-into-academies-in-the-uk-is-wrong\\/#comment-50964","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8d059dcc1ddee9a5ac81a5f3e5fbb3a8?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8d059dcc1ddee9a5ac81a5f3e5fbb3a8?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8d059dcc1ddee9a5ac81a5f3e5fbb3a8?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8d059dcc1ddee9a5ac81a5f3e5fbb3a8?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/50964"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/29240"}]}},{"id":50963,"post":29144,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"VictorMalcaLaw","author_url":"https:\\/\\/victormalcalaw.com\\/","date":"2022-03-29T09:44:19","date_gmt":"2022-03-29T07:44:19","content":{"rendered":"<p>It really impacted a lot on education especially on Kindergarten students.

The classroom is a place where different kinds of pupils having different level of exposures, upbringing, mental acuity and intellectual capabilities converge to be taught which however justify that a classroom is made up of two categories of student; fast learner and slow learner. The importance of private tutoring cannot be undermined as a veritable tool in responding to some personal, financial and economic challenges of an individual and a nation as a whole. In a country like Nigeria where close to 90 million Nigerians live in poverty (NBS, 2020), private tutoring has served as a source of income to many unemployed youths who would rather be paid stipend as a private tutor than to steal. An average Nigerian teacher receives 20dollars (ten thousand naira only) as a salary which is too small for personal survival let alone family upkeep and of such needs additional means of income. Private tutoring also serves as a mental-leveller between fast learner and slow learner.  The mental acuity of a child differs from the other. Some could learn in a noisy classroom while some cannot. Some pupils could understand a concept just at a glance while some could take months to understand. Some could learn without any additional effort of a teacher while some could learn by extra efforts of a teacher and to such, private tutoring could be a solution. A slow learner is however subjected to private tutoring if the parents wouldn\\u2019t want to waste school fees and at the same record child\\u2019s academic progress. In addition to this, private tutoring makes a child mentally busy and academically dutiful at home. It is believed that \\u201can idle hand is the devil\\u2019s workshop\\u2019\\u2019. The prevalent socio-economic crimes in Nigeria among the youths could be traced to laxity of hands at home. Rather than being busy watching immoral movies of corrupting practices, a child could be busied with private tutoring so as to keep his\\/her mind safe and also instill studying culture in the home. Remember, charity begins at home.<br \\/>\\nThe potential implications of the new regulations of shadow education in China could be viewed from two-dimensional angle. One, it could lead to increase in illiteracy ratio as no nation can outgrow its level of education. The illiteracy level of china is close to 6% as at 2020 which if adequate measures are not put in place may increase gradually. There is no bad without a good side. A pupil who understand a concept when spent much time with may lose interest in school where there\\u2019s little or no attention for his deficiencies. Hence, private tutoring is the answer.  Two, it may lower some teachers financial capacity since it is an additional stream of income and this will definitely lead to poverty ratio increment if shadow education is stopped.<br \\/>\\nIn my own point of view, it is necessary that educational authorities regulate shadow education. Using Nigeria as an example, most private tutors are not professional\\/ licensed teachers which has made Nigerian teaching profession to be bastardized in terms of poor methods of teaching, involvement of teachers in examination malpractices and pervasive sexual abuse of pupils\\/students by private tutors. In the case of china, it is germane to regulate shadow education so that the image of its teaching profession can be preserved, respected and valued. Also, it is incumbent upon educational authorities to regulate shadow education so that teachers would put in their best in ensuring every concept in a subject is well taught and understood by pupils without any need for private tutorials. By doing this, the quality of the nation\\u2019s education would be highly, positively and jealously maintained. Lastly, as an educational expert, if shadow education is not regulated, the future of China is questionable because a little excess breeds extremism. To be remembered, there\\u2019s no good without a bad side (vice versa) if not well regulated.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2021\\/08\\/06\\/china-clamps-down-on-private-tutoring\\/#comment-50937","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/a4707fd84e798690544f9d9d765116a4?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/a4707fd84e798690544f9d9d765116a4?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/a4707fd84e798690544f9d9d765116a4?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/a4707fd84e798690544f9d9d765116a4?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/50937"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/14485"}]}},{"id":50936,"post":14943,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Sudhakaran Balakrishnan","author_url":"","date":"2022-02-07T08:03:13","date_gmt":"2022-02-07T07:03:13","content":{"rendered":"<p>The aim of education is to develop the physical, emotional and intellectual faculties of young people.

Almost every teacher use it as an avenue to make extra money. Although it is not completely their fault, I share the blame between the Nigerian government (with no solid education policies on ground), the parents and school leadership who see it as &#8220;ok&#8221; for children to be privately  tutored by the same or another teacher in order to &#8220;pass&#8221; their examinations. We fail to understand that the children are placed under a lot of pressure to pass their examinations. And some parents are not making it any easier for these children. These parents go as far as threatening to withdraw some privileges if these examinations are not passed gloriously because lot of money has been paid to the school and private teachers to make sure success is achieved. This clearly supports the teachers to demand for after school private tutoring even when they are in a position to teach the children as duty demands. They prefer to push their responsibilities to after school where they can get paid for doing what they should have done in the morning at school.<br \\/>\\nSecondly, the school leadership puts the teachers under situational pressure because no student should fail any internal or external examinations. No school wants to appear unsuccessful as this will tag the school as &#8220;low&#8221; achievers! Every school strives to succeed even at the expense of the children&#8217;s emotional well-being not fully cared for. All that matters to them is to brag about their trophies and medals being displayed either as objects or in human form. Some boast &#8220;Our school has high successful results in our examinations!&#8221; How pitiful!!!!<br \\/>\\nI am a teacher and a parent. I will be unfair to my daughter who just got back from school at 4pm, tired and exhausted from all the activities she had to go through at school. Who probably had a bad day with friends and teacher, only for her to come home and meet another teacher waiting for another round of school! What a life of horror?!!<br \\/>\\nI honestly think that after school private tutoring should be banned in Nigeria.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2021\\/08\\/06\\/china-clamps-down-on-private-tutoring\\/#comment-50911","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9adfd1d568b78a94558999ed2a13b5e4?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9adfd1d568b78a94558999ed2a13b5e4?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9adfd1d568b78a94558999ed2a13b5e4?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/9adfd1d568b78a94558999ed2a13b5e4?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/50911"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/14485"}]}},{"id":50910,"post":14930,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Dr. Tusiime Ramadhan","author_url":"","date":"2021-12-25T13:59:38","date_gmt":"2021-12-25T12:59:38","content":{"rendered":"<p>Would like to participate fully.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2021\\/12\\/17\\/call-for-expressions-of-interest-now-open-for-the-2023-gem-report-on-technology\\/#comment-50910","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8714cd188651b907b3c6984b7eebce90?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8714cd188651b907b3c6984b7eebce90?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8714cd188651b907b3c6984b7eebce90?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/8714cd188651b907b3c6984b7eebce90?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/50910"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/14930"}]}},{"id":50909,"post":14943,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"E Serry","author_url":"http:\\/\\/britishqualificationsschool.wordpress.com","date":"2021-12-23T13:57:49","date_gmt":"2021-12-23T12:57:49","content":{"rendered":"<p>No matter what we do with tertiary education the gap between industry and education will always be there. In fact the gap between the skills wanted by the employers and the skills produced by the tertiary education will get worse. This reasons for this are quite obvious:<br \\/>\\n1- Industry is more flexible than education when it comes to implementing new technology. Implementing new technology in industry saves money, including new technology in education costs money (both in using and training on).<br \\/>\\n2- The length of time need to implement a change is much faster than in education. While at best scenario both industry and education should be applying a continuous development process, in industry adopting the new ways happens in a much shorter time than the time needed to update curriculum or qualification specifications.<br \\/>\\n3- In the qualification based education (Degree, Diploma) the length of time needed to complete the qualification is too long that by the time the qualification is achieved (3\\/4 years + 1 years to find a job), a lot of what has been taught is rendered obsolete in the work place. This results in the graduate needing either retraining or at best upskilling when they start their first job after graduation.<br \\/>\\n4- Now and more in future industry is seeking creativity and individualism (technology and innovation). The 20th century move towards complete standarisation which was a result of the automation revolution is disappearing. This is due to the introduction of artificial intelligence which allows the machine to react in a creative rather than standardized way. While at the same time education as a whole seeks conformity (one specification teaching one set of skills to all students on the course using set learning outcomes). Only at the research level in education where creativity is allowed.<br \\/>\\n5- The cost of teaching a set of skills inside education institutes is much higher than the cost of teaching the same set of skills in the working environment.<br \\/>\\n6- In the majority of the times the teaching staff in the education system have minimum or no real experience in using the skills they are teaching. The only exception is the apprenticeships.

But it is also understandable in a way, even though, in my opinion, education should always a priority to any country, there are seemingly more pressing dangers at the moment. The whole world economy took a big hit, but especially in poorer countries that difference might make the biggest impact, on the already small budget for education. On the other hand, one day the world will recover from the impacts of Covid-19 and there might be a window of opportunity to transform the education systems that are in trouble. External help from richer countries is a way to help with this, but I&#8217;m seeing a trend, like this article mentions, of investing in the own national problems first and the poorer countries might be forgotten, just like with the distribution of the vaccine. I am hopeful that eventually, the financial troubles will pass and the investment in education will grow again, but it will take a global effort to do so. A decent education for everyone will make the world a better, more prosperous place, I&#8217;m certain of it, but it will take some time to recover from the economic disaster.

I have personal experience with bullying and I know first-hand the damage it can cause a child. While I was growing up, we moved around quite a bit. This resulted in me starting the second grade in a new school. Being the new kid in school, I was a target and unfortunately got bullied by some of my peers. I was always very quiet and quite small for my age, so they knew I was an easy target. My parents started to notice that I was becoming very depressed and did not want to go to school so they sat me down had asked me what was wrong. At first, I did not want to tell them as I was embarrassed, but I knew I could keep living like this. I finally told my parents what was going on and they decided to keep me at home for a couple of days. My teacher phoned my mom to find out why I have not been to school and my mom explained the situation to her. Unfortunately, my school did not have a policy against bullying in place and I was told by my principal to suck it up and learn to stand up for myself. With no other choice, I learned to stand up for myself and did not allow anyone to treat me like that again. I wish my school had a zero-tolerance policy for bullying because although I was lucky enough to learn how to stand up for myself, not all students were able to do that.<br \\/>\\nLuckily, things have changed in most schools and educators have realized that bullying creates an unsafe environment in which students cannot thrive. At my current school, we have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to bullying. We make use of multiple strategies to teach students the effects that bullying has on others including celebrating inclusivity and diversity, bully awareness month, and using PBIS throughout our school.<br \\/>\\nWhen students are reassured and feel safe in their school environment, they are able to concentrate and learn more effectively.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/11\\/04\\/together-against-bullying-in-school\\/#comment-48421","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d30acd6537dd80f3ff838247349f7c69?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d30acd6537dd80f3ff838247349f7c69?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d30acd6537dd80f3ff838247349f7c69?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d30acd6537dd80f3ff838247349f7c69?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/48421"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13512"}]}},{"id":48415,"post":13726,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Millennium@EDU SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION","author_url":"","date":"2021-01-27T09:25:11","date_gmt":"2021-01-27T08:25:11","content":{"rendered":"<p>Reblogged this on <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/armillenniumedu.wordpress.com\\/2021\\/01\\/27\\/unlocking-financing-for-equity-in-education\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">Site Title<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2021\\/01\\/25\\/unlocking-financing-for-equity-in-education\\/#comment-48415","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/48415"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13726"}]}},{"id":48327,"post":13011,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Mahavir Bhartiya","author_url":"","date":"2021-01-19T09:56:17","date_gmt":"2021-01-19T08:56:17","content":{"rendered":"<p>That is not a caste system &#8211;

My name is Molly and I love learning about fitness and healthy lifestyle. I have been working out from home ever since I had my daughter (who is now 3). I thought I would miss the gym and taking classes more than anything, but I have grown to love my at home workouts and am amazed by how much is out there. Over the years I have put together a library of fitness videos that I love. Most of them are thirty minutes as that is the most time I can give and it is enough with the workouts I tend to do. I have been sharing good videos\\/intructors I have found with my friends and family for years and would love to share them with others as well. So many people would love to incorporate exercise into their life, but they do not know where to start. As we are going through a pandemic many people are looking for ways to stay active at home. I love doing strength training, pilates, hiit, bodyweight, etc. and will share with you some of my favorite workouts I have found.

This is because the importance and linkage of education to the development of any society cannot be over-emphasized. It argues that for a society to develop, education must be inclusive (including the physically challenged). It examines the prospect of inclusive education within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with particular reference to goal number four. It contextualizes this within the challenges facing the education system in Nigeria. The paper adopts a quantitative method of inquiry. A total of 200 copies of the questionnaire were distributed and 188 were retrieved and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 17.0) software. Preliminary findings suggest that the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs 4) in Nigeria\\u2019s education system towards the physically challenged is in serious jeopardy and requires immediate policy revalidation. The study concludes that for a meaningful development to be achieved by Nigeria, every citizen (physically challenged inclusive), must have access to knowledge, skills, and information.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/09\\/02\\/singing-from-the-same-song-sheet-growing-momentum-across-the-disability-movement-to-adopt-a-comprehensive-definition-of-inclusive-education-to-achieve-sdg-4\\/#comment-46124","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5aea8d6be557abae826926ea7fe8708f?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5aea8d6be557abae826926ea7fe8708f?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5aea8d6be557abae826926ea7fe8708f?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5aea8d6be557abae826926ea7fe8708f?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/46124"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13297"}]}},{"id":46114,"post":13279,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Sujay Rao Mandavilli","author_url":"http:\\/\\/sujayraomandavilli.wordpress.com","date":"2020-09-10T15:36:55","date_gmt":"2020-09-10T13:36:55","content":{"rendered":"<p>it is my firm belief that developing counties and non-European cultures must play a key role in the formulation of social science theory in the 21st century.

The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has reported that inclusion strategies have not equally been implemented in schools. In addition, inconsistencies between legislative and policy instruments in the field of education and beyond can be a significant barrier to inclusion, for instance allowing segregation and integration practices to coexist. <\\/p>\\n<p>Even if the political will to foster inclusion has been expressed in strategic documents and\\/or legislation, resistance to inclusion may persist. Follow-up actions are necessary and need to be tailored to the historical, political, cultural and socio-economic contexts. The 2020 GEM Report tries to answer the question: How can common obstacles to implementation of these solutions be anticipated and overcome? <\\/p>\\n<p>First, monitoring is essential to promote the implementation of inclusion. The UN CRPD calls for the establishment of a national framework for its implementation and monitoring (art. 33), which is done by many countries. In this respect, countries have established national monitoring systems to foster inclusion in education. In New Brunswick, Canada, the superintendent monitors the performance of each school based on performance indicators for inclusive education, which include ongoing professional development for administrators, teachers, educational assistants, and other professionals. In the Cook Islands, all principals have the responsibility to monitor the implementation of the inclusive education policy (<a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.education-profiles.org\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">GEM Report PEER<\\/a>). In general, national Education Management Information Systems (EMIS), helps monitor the inclusion of education programmes and manage the distribution and allocation of educational resources. (You can also consult <a href=\\"http:\\/\\/gem-report-2017.unesco.org\\/en\\/makeitpublic-does-you-country-have-a-national-monitoring-report\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">here<\\/a> the list of countries that have a national education monitoring report).<\\/p>\\n<p>Second, cross-sector collaboration can also help overcome and anticipate the challenges that often hinder implementation. Integrated service delivery to individuals and households with complex disabilities and who need services from multiple providers can be a solution. In Moldova, for instance, ministries and government agencies in the education, social protection and assistance, and health sectors work together on delivering inclusive educational and social services to make the education system more inclusive. <\\/p>\\n<p>Third and as the report highlights, social biases and attitudes towards inclusion can be important obstacles to implementation. Reforming teacher and other personnel education programmes might encourage a shift in the school management practices. In Singapore, teachers in regular schools are initially trained to acquire an understanding of disability, while a more extensive in-service training provides them with the necessary skills to support the inclusion of students with disabilities, with the assistance of trained Allied Educators.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/06\\/29\\/your-questions-answered-pose-your-questions-live-to-the-authors-of-the-2020-gem-report\\/#comment-44592","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44592"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13160"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44412"}]}},{"id":44574,"post":12892,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Toma","author_url":"","date":"2020-07-05T11:41:01","date_gmt":"2020-07-05T09:41:01","content":{"rendered":"<p>SCHOOL PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19<\\/p>\\n<p>This is a COVID-19 notification for public &amp; private schools.

First, the priority should be the present of education: hundreds of millions today have no access not just to internet or devices but even to televisions and radios \\u2013 and are therefore completely excluded from learning. Second, even online solutions are poor substitutes of learning in classrooms and they should be developed to complement learning in classrooms, not to replace it. <\\/p>\\n<p>As you put it in one of the recommendations in your article, systems should pay \\u2018more attention to resilience in the face of systemic risk\\u2019. The pandemic risk should not have been ignored \\u2013 there was a 25% chance that it could happen in the space of a generation, and there were many signs it could break out, but they were ignored. This should not happen again: disaster risk reduction has to be part of education planning.<\\/p>\\n<p>There is no doubt that the \\u2018familiar forms\\u2019 of education have major weaknesses. They have been associated with teaching appropriate for industrial societies where everybody had to fit the system. It therefore depends on how education systems in \\u2018familiar form\\u2019 or \\u2018redeveloped\\u2019 are to be defined. Assuming that the Covid-19 disruption is temporary and that the \\u2018familiar form\\u2019 of a classroom cannot be changed, the only viable option is that of regeneration. The type of regeneration the 2020 GEM Report is advocating for, one where the system adapts to students and their needs.<\\/p>\\n<p>Covid-19 has changed the perception of many teachers who were confronted with the realities of their students and their living conditions.

The Report finds, for instance, that only 14 out of 54 countries in Africa have reported data on learning outcomes since 2014. Although reporting is not the ultimate objective, it is a sign that countries are not putting sufficient priority in this area. This should change.<\\/p>\\n<p>Second, country ownership should take priority over international comparability. The SDG 4 monitoring framework is first and foremost a formative mechanism, aimed at prompting countries to do what is needed; it is not an exercise to rank countries. For that reason, it is open to multiple sources of information. In the case of learning outcomes, both national and cross-national assessments can be used to report, provided they meet certain quality criteria. In practice:<br \\/>\\n&#8211; On the one hand, even if countries have experience conducting national examinations, this does not mean they can conduct sample-based learning assessments, which have distinct technical challenges.<br \\/>\\n&#8211; On the other hand, even highly standardized cross-national learning assessments require significant local capacity in order to generate valid data. <\\/p>\\n<p>Greater investment in assessment capacity should also focus on using such assessments to identify inequities and inform policies by tapping into the capacity of local higher education institutions and independent researchers. Making datasets and the results of their analyses publicly available is key and requires a willingness by governments to be held to account by their research communities. Such publicly available results can be a key tool for advocates who can then lobby governments to improve the quality of their assessments.<\\/p>\\n<p>International organisations, including UNESCO and specifically the UIS, facilitate actions on both fronts but more could be done if additional resources were available:<br \\/>\\n&#8211; They need to continue investigating how the prohibitive cost of standards-compliant implementation of internationally comparable assessments can be reduced, and investigate the lessons learned. External assistance is currently uncoordinated and insufficiently focused on ensuring both capacity development and data availability. This is an area in which the Report will be paying more interest.<br \\/>\\n&#8211; Peer learning between countries, as for instance through the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning, is a good starting point but requires more resources.<br \\/>\\nfrom <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/en.unesco.org\\/gem-report\\/node\\/2328\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">Bilal Barakat<\\/a><\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/06\\/29\\/your-questions-answered-pose-your-questions-live-to-the-authors-of-the-2020-gem-report\\/#comment-44417","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44417"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13160"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44378"}]}},{"id":44416,"post":13160,"parent":44394,"author":0,"author_name":"GEM Report","author_url":"","date":"2020-06-29T21:11:16","date_gmt":"2020-06-29T19:11:16","content":{"rendered":"<p>The theme of the 2020 Report \\u201cInclusion and education\\u201d is particularly encompassing of the issues in the education systems globally, and calls for broad changes to education systems in order to reach all in education, particularly the furthest behind. Our report is global in nature, but its recommendations can be implemented by all the countries in the world. Though, we understand that each region has particular characteristics that need to be further analyzed, and probably need region-specific recommendations. To have a more regional-relevant analysis, we are preparing regional reports. In October 2020, we\\u2019ll launch the 2020 Latin American Regional Report, which can be readily used by national governments to mobilize sub-national and local levels with regionally-relevant recommendations. The report is to be used as an advocacy tool, to be used by all the stakeholders of the education process at all levels, including those at the local levels.<\\/p>\\n<p>Locally, the actors that are key to inclusion and education are teachers, parents, communities and civil society in general. For education to be inclusive, inclusive teaching is needed. Inclusive teaching requires teachers to recognize the experiences and abilities of every student, to be open to diversity and to be prepared to teach students with varied backgrounds and abilities. This requires that both teachers and Education official who monitor the implementation of inclusive teaching are trained on inclusive education, that the teaching force has good working conditions.<\\/p>\\n<p>Parents, organizations and civil society in general can drive inclusive education, and hence are allies to implement the recommendations locally. Parents can organize networks to press for inclusive education. For example, in the Russian Federation, parents sued the government for access to schools for children with cerebral palsy. A key challenge is to counter negative attitudes, stereotypes and discrimination and prevent their further development, as they can hamper the education of vulnerable students.<\\/p>\\n<p>Civil society is an advocate and watchdog for the right to inclusive education. While the state bears the duty of education, grassroots NGOs and CSOs often step in, especially in poorer countries, to provide education services for populations not reached by governments. Such organizations also lead the way in putting pressure on governments to fulfil their national and international obligations to guarantee the right to inclusive education for all. For example, in Armenia, an NGO campaign resulted in a decision to roll out inclusive education nationally by 2025. Government leadership, dialogue among all parties and a coordinated approach, aligned with national education policies, are essential.<\\/p>\\n<p>Reply from <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/en.unesco.org\\/gem-report\\/rosa-vidarte\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">Rosa Vidarte<\\/a><\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/06\\/29\\/your-questions-answered-pose-your-questions-live-to-the-authors-of-the-2020-gem-report\\/#comment-44416","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b1706e8b926116b0412f5fa1db375e07?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44416"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13160"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44394"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=44416"}]}},{"id":44414,"post":13160,"parent":44400,"author":0,"author_name":"Professor Mel Ainscow","author_url":"https:\\/\\/www.gla.ac.uk\\/schools\\/education\\/staff\\/melainscow\\/","date":"2020-06-29T18:33:21","date_gmt":"2020-06-29T16:33:21","content":{"rendered":"<p>There is extensive research suggesting that when teachers are involved in decision making this is likely to promote a better climate for the learning of all students within a school. There is also evidence that schools which encourage teachers to collaborate in developing their practice are more able to improve student outcomes and reduce achievement gaps. Evidence such as this was part of the justification for the introduction of academies in England (similar to charter schools in the USA). Freed from the restrictions imposed by local authorities, it was argued, such schools would become centres of innovation that would stimulate wider system change. Sadly, the evidence is that this has not been the outcome. Whilst academies have been given space to innovate, this has usually focused on aspects of management and organization, rather than on the development of new, more creative teaching practices. As a result, those learners who do not fit with the standard ways of working are far less welcome. (See: Salokangas, M. and Ainscow, M.

Countries also focus on different risk factors as described also in the  Profiles Enhancing Education Reviews (PEER) (<a href=\\"http:\\/\\/education-profiles.org\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">http:\\/\\/www.education-profiles.org<\\/a>). In terms of laws and policies, only 10% of countries reflect  such a comprehensive vision for all learner  in their general or inclusive education laws. Successful practices in inclusion are supported by robust governance frameworks and structures, financial resources, positive attitudes towards inclusion, as well as measures for collaboration, teacher workforce, initial and continuous teachers and other education professional training and monitoring. All these factors are interdependent. It is not enough to move students from special schools to regular schools. It is not enough to interpret inclusion in terms of placement. Inclusion needs also to be understood in terms of learning and requires a complete change of systems to adapt to everyone&#8217;s needs. <\\/p>\\n<p>Considering the relevance of governance mechanisms, the PEER on inclusion in education tries to go beyond education, collecting information on how the country\\u2019s social legislative and policy documents frame inclusion in education and how coordination takes place. Widening the understanding of inclusive education needs soundness and coherence of cooperation across sectors, which  would enhance the possibility to formulate effective policies for inclusion in education. The profile of India refers to the systematic <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/mhrd.gov.in\\/sites\\/upload_files\\/mhrd\\/files\\/Draft_NEP_2019_EN_Revised.pdf\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">2019 draft India Education Policy <\\/a>that was discussed by the Cabinet in May. Reflecting the SDG 4 objectives, Chapter 6 intends to shape an education system that can reach out to and benefit all children, calling for concrete reforms in the school culture and curriculum, including tailored measures, such as the establishment of Special Education Zones (SEZs) in geographical areas with the largest proportions of underrepresented groups. Within the broad approach of inclusion in education, it is important to recognize and address all learners\\u2019 needs, as highlighted in India\\u2019s draft policy, from the education for girls, to education for transgender children and children belonging to scheduled caste communities and other backward classes, as their characteristics and needs are cross-cutting and might be relevant to all.

The question I put really is an invitation to explore what is meant by the most marginalised both at individual level and at group category level. Never going to school is marginalising and even more so the older you are. But we generally chose to do less for those who are much older than those who are of primary age. Who is most marginalised?    And the problem with the 258 million OOSC is that most of them are over 15 years old &#8211; the minimum legal age of work &#8211; and most of them went to primary school and some lower secondary before dropping out. The most marginalised are therefore a much smaller number globally. But how to balance the needs of the smaller number of most marginalised against the larger numbers of those less marginalised who are nevertheless marginalised beyond some margin. The real world political economy issue is how to reconcile the need for some kind of positive discrimination to compensate for disadvantage with the real politik of power in stratified societies that has difficulty in addressing social inequality in service delivery and quality and in revenue generation.   <\\/p>\\n<p>Thanks for the other points. Borrowing will be especially risky post COVID 19 since the ability to service loans will be compromised by falling tax revenues as recession bites. Thats why grants have to be preserved for those with no other means of investing rather than used to lower loan rates at the cost of foregoing grants to the most marginalised. <\\/p>\\n<p>Good luck in taking this forward<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/06\\/29\\/your-questions-answered-pose-your-questions-live-to-the-authors-of-the-2020-gem-report\\/#comment-44409","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/384a9f3e9effc07816406b3b76a8a1db?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/384a9f3e9effc07816406b3b76a8a1db?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/384a9f3e9effc07816406b3b76a8a1db?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/384a9f3e9effc07816406b3b76a8a1db?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44409"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13160"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44402"}]}},{"id":44408,"post":13160,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"talentfortransition","author_url":"http:\\/\\/gravatar.com\\/talentfortransition","date":"2020-06-29T16:59:02","date_gmt":"2020-06-29T14:59:02","content":{"rendered":"<p>A further issue raised by the GEM Report relates to the accessibility of this thoughtful,  comprehensive and evidence-led commentary.

One in three countries do not meet either of the two international benchmarks for the percentages of GDP and public expenditure dedicated to education, respectively, which means they either have a poor capacity to collect revenues or they do not prioritize education enough &#8211; or both. <\\/p>\\n<p>Even for the poorest countries, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.<br \\/>\\n1. Domestic resource mobilization is the most sustainable solution. Past editions of the Report \\u2013 and an analysis from the World Bank last year \\u2013 have shown that increased spending on education has been mainly the result of stronger ability to raise revenue through taxes.<br \\/>\\n2. However, as the Report this year further emphasizes, spending needs to be more sensitive to different needs, through two main ways: (i) targeting resources to those furthest behind: many general resource allocation mechanisms do not take such needs into account (or even exacerbate inequalities if they rely on local governments to raise revenues for which the poorest ones have low capacity) and (ii) thinking in joined-up terms: not only education budgets contribute to education outcomes; budgets of other social sector ministries can contribute as much, if not more, to education outcomes when they are properly planned. Governments need a twin-track approach that allocates general funding to all learners to promote a comprehensive learning environment and targeted funding to follow the furthest behind as early as possible.<br \\/>\\n3. The allocation of resources between levels of education is a challenge for many countries. The 2019 edition of the Report (Figure 19.4) showed a natural progression that countries follow in the shares they allocate from pre-primary to post-secondary. Extremes need to be avoided. While lack of access even to primary education remains one of the most serious equity challenges, financing of secondary education should not be squeezed since it is needed to produce skilled workers, not least teachers. We know that limited opportunities for secondary schooling may undermine demand for primary education. We also know that the costs of secondary education can be contained through effective planning.<\\/p>\\n<p>With respect to aid to education, the Report notes that aid in general has been declining as a share of the poorest countries\\u2019 economies, although it remains sizeable at 9% for low-income countries, with a slight increase since 2015 (Figure 21.5). Low-income countries have also seen a slight increase in their share of aid to education in recent years.<\\/p>\\n<p>External borrowing has been proposed for middle-income countries, in response to declining shares of education in the multilateral development banks\\u2019 lending portfolios. However, in the current context, with debt levels potentially growing, there might be some concern about the risk of exposing countries to higher levels of borrowing.

Furthermore the provision of such education must not interfere with the education of  other non-disabled students. <\\/p>\\n<p>A similar \\u2018get out clause\\u2019 is located in the provisions of the Irish Equal Status Act 2000, (as amended by the Equality Act 2004), which promotes equality<br \\/>\\nand prohibits discrimination, harassment and related behaviour in connection with the provision of services, property and other opportunities to which the public generally or a section of the public has access. While the provisions of the Act are underpinned by a presumption of mainstreaming for disabled students, s 7 of the Act provides that a school will be exempt from the requirement to provide service to a disabled student only to the extent that to do so would (because of the students\\u2019 disability) have a seriously detrimental effect on the provision of service to other students or would make it impossible to provide services to other students. <\\/p>\\n<p>In this context it is clear that the entitlement to inclusive education is circumscribed by provisions which reference disabled students\\u2019 entitlement to inclusive education to the education of other students. Of particular note however, is the fact that disabled students\\u2019 entitlement to inclusive education is not referenced to the education of their non-disabled peers. <\\/p>\\n<p>It follows that many policies conceived within the existing legislative framework, lay the basis for a \\u2018dressed up\\u2019 version of traditional practices which endorse and promote the placement and treatment  of students perceived to be difficult to segregated school settings, separate &#8216;pull out&#8217; support programmes etc where medical model thinking continues to be reinforced.<\\/p>\\n<p>Kingston, Miriam (2006) Restricted Recognition: Teachers in the Irish Education System &#8211; A Barrier to Inclusive Education?\\u00a0The Disability Archive at disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/06\\/26\\/jean-paul-gaultier-hillary-clinton-shakira-pele-yalitza-aparicio-and-others-join-in-calling-for-more-inclusive-education\\/#comment-44398","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/34a40adb63ad0d8d9c462fef3ae20e35?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/34a40adb63ad0d8d9c462fef3ae20e35?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/34a40adb63ad0d8d9c462fef3ae20e35?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/34a40adb63ad0d8d9c462fef3ae20e35?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/44398"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/13153"}]}}]'

There are indeed examples of initiatives that guide the understanding of school leaders, teachers and parents.<\\/p>\\n<p>In Kenya, for example, in partnership with the Ministry of Education and UNICEF, Unified Champion Schools has helped assess and refer children identified with intellectual disabilities, following up with workshops on inclusive education with families, teachers and school leaders. The project has enrolled nearly 600 students with intellectual disabilities and has helped develop positive attitudes towards these students in participating schools. Special Olympics contributed to the development of the national inclusive education policy, including drafting an easy to read version. Unified Champion Schools, in partnership with Catholic Relief Services, continues Special Olympics Kenya\\u2019s work on early childhood development for children with intellectual disabilities through the Young Athletes programme. Identifying children in need of services early helps support families, providing a hopeful vision for their children\\u2019s future and disproving widely held myths about ability to learn (<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.specialolympics.org\\/stories\\/impact\\/opening-eyes-in-kenya\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">Special Olympics Kenya, 2018<\\/a>).<\\/p>\\n<p>Afghanistan is another example regarding the involvement of the community. Afghanistan is marked by several exclusion challenges: security issues that expose schools as targets for attacks; cultural beliefs that systematically exclude girls and children with disabilities; and poverty, which exacerbates geographical and climate challenges in remote mountainous areas. Community-based education has been a key mechanism in addressing these challenges. The system is primarily made up of community-based classes and accelerated learning programmes jointly established and implemented by provincial and district education departments, communities and NGOs (<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.humanitarianresponse.info\\/sites\\/www.humanitarianresponse.info\\/files\\/documents\\/files\\/cbe_policy_guidelines_2018.pdf\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">Afghanistan Ministry of Education, 2018<\\/a>).

I think that the current situation of organizing online teaching and learning poses indeed major challenges to the delivery of quality education.

It is a battle we must fight to win.Unfortunately, the front liners in this very important battle often do not command the composure required in fighting a sensitive battle.  Advocacy must be strategic and systematic. in this case, the very important value of girls and women education is often being presented as if it a battle to equalize or fight the men to submission.<br \\/>\\nThe truth of the matter is, that women have SPECIAL VALUE. And this can can bring to bear in the human development process. Besides their huge demographic population, they posses tremendous value even traditional societies. In many societies they are the backbone of the economy. What the advocates of girls and women education ought to fully grasp is to appreciate the fact that every society has it cultural and traditional sensitivities. The cultural sensitivities of Saudi  Arabia are different from Egypt or Tunisia despite their seeming homogeneity in religion . Extending this line of thought to other regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia gives a multiplicity of cultural and traditional  sensitivities  that should inform any meaningful strategy that is context specific in addressing  this all important global agenda. Many women who are front liners in pushing this important agenda lack the understanding of these critical sensitivities and even the moral carriage to be models of the value of the woman.<br \\/>\\nThe use of the word  EQUALITY naturally evokes aggression or conflict particularly in very sensitive cultures. Equality yes, but the crucial issue is that the girl child and the women have very SPECIAL VALUE even in traditional societies. And that education will surely enhance these values to the benefit of belonging families, the community and society at large. TODAY even in traditional societies women are the backbones of the economies of their families and their communities. With access to quality and functional education the life and economic enlistment of their families and community will shoot to the level of dignity and human happiness.<br \\/>\\nWHAT WE MUST DO is to develop our strategies informed by these cultural sensitivities and surely victory is assured.

That would require a switch in teaching mode and a change of the educational culture. The examination preparation has probably too big a role in the teaching practices and orientations.

dilemma for the Education policy makers with a twin mix of what to do between closure of schools to save lives and temporary laying off workers and still retain access to education at all levels.The problem facing Senegal is a global phenomenon and many developing Countries like Senegal will be faced by new challenges of -1 Home schooling which will disrupt entrenched family culture of work like farming and parenting as well as the social life of children and parents which will definitely be affected. 2- The effectiveness of online distance education adopted globally which to me may not impart positively to pedagogy in many developing Countries especially in Africa where many rural communities have limited or little access to internet, unreliable electricity supply, and faced with extreme poverty ..This will have a long impact on the quality of outcome and output of the system<br \\/>\\nOf worrisome issue is the scenario of increased in the rate of domestic violence due to

Students must valued themselves as critical thinkers. Leading a plural learning process that takes place in the interaction with video recording experiences, witnesses from in context view, imagines, archives, visions of different ways of living that google earth provides, all sources of knowledge that are now standing as separate platform, medium, may become parts of a comprehensive and integrated teaching infrastructure, where navigating knowledge is essential.<br \\/>\\nThis dramatic situation which forces all of us to teach through the digital is also an unpredictable and unforeseen window to dream and to design the education paradigm we want.

Teachers are called to act in a new way and the experiences they all represent &#8211; as living sources of good practices &#8211; must now be integrated and compounded into an overall portrait that lifts all of us up into a new paradigm.

I expect various forms of personalised testing options will increase &#8211; following from the personalised learning ones already proliferating like Byju&#8217;s and Khan Academy etc. PISA has already developed adaptive, computer-based testing as has NAPLAN in Australia &#8211; these are likely to become widely available and perhaps even available to individual subscription. Or school systems may buy up subscription to such individualised learning and assessment plans &#8211; side-lining teacher-led assessments. Of course this will massively increase the inequality that already exists with large segments of the population unable to access the technologies required to run these programs. Or perhaps the world will see tablets becoming more evenly distributed, high-speed internet made available widely for free by governments &#8211; and such measures may go some distance towards creating some equality, even though the advantages associated with socio-cultural background will take a couple of generations to overcome. But what about basics like electricity to run these devices? Will the reduced power consumption that may result from reduced consumption in general post-COVID make for a more equitable distribution of these basics?<br \\/>\\nIt is, of course, not clear what effects of &#8216;personalised learning&#8217; and &#8216;personalised assessment&#8217; will have on both learning and on society. In terms of learning, &#8216;personalisation&#8217; will depend very much on some generalised &#8216;standardisation&#8217; that provides the norms that under-grid the adaptive systems. Typically, these will be black boxed and therefore will not be easy to critique. This means that a particular conception of &#8216;learning&#8217; will get even more globalised. As to learning, what happens to epistemology when a social act such as learning, which depends on common sense-making, loses the &#8216;society&#8217; of current classrooms remains to be seen. Perhaps virtual classrooms will replace them admirably, even if not always synchronously. Perhaps not. In terms of implications for society, it is worth pondering how &#8216;individualised learning&#8217; (mimicking individualised medicine and precision medicine) might affect our sociability and sense of social responsibility. But perhaps COVID will teach us that our own well-being depends on the well-being of others, and within that context, people will find ways to make learning more widely available and accessible to all.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/03\\/20\\/could-coronavirus-shape-the-way-assessments-work-forever\\/#comment-42837","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6b971796815e48dcfc54fc78f46cc2c5?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6b971796815e48dcfc54fc78f46cc2c5?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6b971796815e48dcfc54fc78f46cc2c5?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6b971796815e48dcfc54fc78f46cc2c5?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/42837"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/12755"}]}},{"id":42831,"post":12752,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"\\u042d\\u0434\\u0432\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434 \\u041d\\u043e\\u0440\\u0442\\u043e\\u043d","author_url":"http:\\/\\/robertmgorton.wordpress.com","date":"2020-03-19T12:10:15","date_gmt":"2020-03-19T11:10:15","content":{"rendered":"<p>Very good and high quality text with great tips.

While there is little I would disagree with it is, i think, worthwhile noting that there is a very wide spectrum of private actors in education and some (particularly those that are not for profit and working with marginalised communities &#8211; or the &#8220;furthest behind&#8221;) play a critical role in providing access to quality education. Marginalised groups can face a multitude of barriers to education and for systematic, or other, reasons cannot access state schools. Migrants for example may be excluded due to not having the required documentation, xenophobia or because they fear deportation. Indigenous groups, minority ethnic groups, religious minorities etc may have deep distrust of public systems (generally with good reason). In other context, and in fragile or conflict affected states in particular, at best it may take another generation before the state has the resources to fulfill its obligation to provide a quality education for all its citizens (with those most disadvantaged within such countries often the last to benefit from any improved services). And thats even if they were to receive the necessary supports. <\\/p>\\n<p>Private actors, that are not for profit, can play a critical role here in terms of supplementing state provision of education by for example:<br \\/>\\na. providing access to quality education that marginalised groups would not otherwise have access to<br \\/>\\nb. advocating and providing supports to improve state systems<br \\/>\\nc. when appropriate (and particularly when the government are genuinely intent) acting as a bridge between the the marginalised group and the state to build trust and understanding. They may also have established models of education provision that is relevant and effective for marginalised groups (particularly relevant for minority ethnic groups for example). . <\\/p>\\n<p>This of course does not mean that the state is not the duty bearer. It is and need to be supported. And while the private sector is certainly not the solution to achieving SDG 4, they do I think have a critical role to play.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2020\\/02\\/26\\/are-private-actors-the-solution-to-achieve-sdg-4\\/#comment-42456","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c5cad3a9ddea59ef1343f786794f1eb1?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c5cad3a9ddea59ef1343f786794f1eb1?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c5cad3a9ddea59ef1343f786794f1eb1?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c5cad3a9ddea59ef1343f786794f1eb1?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/42456"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/12694"}]}},{"id":42428,"post":12654,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"boammaaruri","author_url":"http:\\/\\/boammaaruri.wordpress.com","date":"2020-02-18T07:48:25","date_gmt":"2020-02-18T06:48:25","content":{"rendered":"<p>Do the interventions and programs take into account the differences in career interests between men and women?<br \\/>\\n1.

From view of this specially sensitive sicentific branch for optimal child self-development I&#8217;ve composed some improvements to existing UNESCO Concept of inclusiion in National School Systems which I think are necessary for better understanding how teachers affect different children in classrooms and cause various positive and negative effects to their development.<br \\/>\\nIn Slovenia progress toward inclussion actually didn&#8217;t happen yet although there are some trials from expert Institution for Education. Slovene Ministary of Education still tends toward exclusive education and graduate pressure on learners with more severe punnishing unwanted behaviors and conflicts in schools without real understanding what&#8217;s the cause of such unwanted behaviors and conflicts. The procedures for excluding learners are progressing through legislation to faster elimination of disturbing learners from educational process. So we can say that actual Slovene School System is highly exclusive in comparison to definition of inclusive &#8220;child-centred&#8221; eduction System (UNESCO 2005, p. 27) where &#8220;Seeing education from the inclucive lens implies a shift from seeing the child as a problem to seeing the education system as the problem that can be solved through inclusive approaches&#8221;. Inclusive shift in Slovenia will not happen if government will proceed with exclusive politics. Maybe a warm admonition to Slovene Government for right inclusive course could be welcome.<\\/p>\\n<p>                                                                      Introduction<\\/p>\\n<p>From aspect of UNESCO documents 1990-2020 as the platform for further development of Inclusive National School Systems (NSS), by my oppinion some improvements and upgrades could be added which could make NSS more &#8220;adapted&#8221; to children optimal self-development.<br \\/>\\nBasic platform concerning mentioned UNESCO documents for inclusive education is very well done, but nothing is so good that can&#8217;t be better. Child self-development can be understood more clear and teachers&#8217; behavioral effects in classrooms less problematic and harming through punnishing and rewarding of unwanted or wanted learners behaviors if understanding how basically Living beings function would be achieved. Psychology, Neurosicence and Cognitive  Science etc.  are not providing enough knowledge for full understanding how basically Living beings function. I&#8217;m proposing MSA approcah which could offer wider knowledge about curriculum organization and optimized realization of school programs in classrooms and thus optimized effects on child self-development.<br \\/>\\nPractice of classical productivity school programs and of course practice in classrooms proves that teacher behavior can lead into stress and psychical and\\/or psychosomatic problems of learners. More or less severe conflicts can take place in classrooms.  Learners are different by their biological (genetical) origins and  that can&#8217;t be changed. But learning environments and teacher&#8217;s actions can be improved to the level that can enable optimal development of biological (genetical) learners potentials and prevent negative developmental effects.<br \\/>\\nAlthough direction of inclusive changes provided by UNESCO are very good and promise critical changes in National School Systems i think that some optional changes should be done with special emphasize to :<br \\/>\\n1.\\tNew Glossary (UNESCO 1990 and UNESCO 2017) should introduce new terms and redifine some already established terms for better understanding of basic processing of school programs and consequently inclusive processing in classrooms.<br \\/>\\n2.\\tMSA aprrocah should be introduced for better clarification of Concepts, Policy statements, Structures and systems, Inclusive practices\\u2026<br \\/>\\n3.\\tNew fundamentals for functioning of human organism (and nervous system) should be used with improved understanding how teachers and learners basically function as Living beings so that understanding of basic relationship between teachers and learners can be cleared up including understanding of what kind of developmental effects different teacher&#8217;s behavior produce on different learners. <\\/p>\\n<p>                                                CONTENT OF PROPOSALS <\\/p>\\n<p>1.\\tBrief overview of actual problems in National School Systems and possible solutions for upgrading classical (integrative) school systems into inclusive.<br \\/>\\n2.\\tGlossary. Terminological improvement. Terms like learning, education, self-regulation, self-development, control, cooperation, conflicts\\u2026 could be defined in MSA manner.<br \\/>\\n3.\\tProblematic &#8220;Black box&#8221; teachers&#8217; approcah in classrooms with punnishments and rewards has to be replaced with improved MSA understanding how human (child) organism function and what kind of consequences can teachers&#8217; expect while applying different behaviors on learners.<br \\/>\\n4.\\tMSA aprrocah to curriculum understanding as the whole approach to creating optimal learning environments for more effective realization of educational plans in the direction of inclusion. Partial scientific disciplinary subjects or interdisciplinary understanding of curriculum has to be improved.<br \\/>\\n5.\\tHigher and long term goals in curriculum has to be directed into support of optimal self-development of individual learners and their potentials as basis for later optimal participation in inclusive society.<br \\/>\\n6.\\tConcrete solutions of slow introducing inclusive strategy into classical productivity NSS will be proposed.<br \\/>\\n7.\\tReplacement of factography in school curriculum with more usefull Life knowledge will be proposed.<\\/p>\\n<p>Brief explanation of basic points :<br \\/>\\n1.\\tShort Overwiev of actual problems in National School systems :<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tProductivity. Problem of &#8220;transffering&#8221; teachers knowledge on learners and efficiency of &#8220;school knowledge&#8221; in Life.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tScientific disciplinary and interdisciplinary based curriculum offers too narrow approcah to understanding &#8220;Great picture of the World and Universe&#8221;.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\t&#8220;Integration&#8221; and problem of &#8220;special needs&#8221;<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tUse of external motivation (fear, punishment, rewards\\u2026as behavioristic theoretical background) instead of internal motivation.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tNot adequate understanding of teachers &#8220;feedback&#8221; to learners while teachers are &#8220;transmitting&#8221; knowledge.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tHealth problems of learners and other side effects of classical productivity schoolling. Beside too narrow intelectual developmental effects, also emotional and other psycho-physiological problems occur during educational process,<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tLack of &#8220;Life-skills&#8221; in curriculum or &#8220;Life skills&#8221; are defined too narrow.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tLack of bases for Life-long learning. Life long learning needs MSA support with basic understanding what learning and educating are.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tFactography in curriculum. Too much data and knowledge of no Life-use.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tEtc.<\\/p>\\n<p>All points about actual problems in School Systems arround the World will be compared with inslusive concept of solving problems in School System.<\\/p>\\n<p>2.\\tGlossary (terminology) improvement :<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tSome basic terms and definitions already accounted in documents (1990, 2017) needs modification in accordance to MSA approcah, and should be redefined in the course of inclusive paradigm. Some new terms should be added for better understanding what is practically happening in schools and classrooms and how to progress toward inclusion.<br \\/>\\n\\u2022\\tOptimized Glossary could also enable better understanding and inclusive managment of school curriculum and better inclusive management in classrooms. <\\/p>\\n<p>3.\\tProblematic &#8220;Black box&#8221; approach in schools includes problem of understanding how Living beings (organisms) function and the way teacher affect children self-development. Central term is child self-development based on understanding how children psycho-physiologically and socialy function. MSA approach could enable more clear understanding how children (Living beings) function and thus offer possibility of producing more weihgty effects of teacher&#8217;s behavior on different children personalities. &#8220;Black box&#8221; approach can make damage to child self-development if teachers don&#8217;t understand what kind of effects are happening while acting on learners. Also new inclusive strategies for approaches to child optimal self-development will be proposed and teachers &#8220;White-box&#8221; effects will be presented.<\\/p>\\n<p>4.\\tMSA aprroach (&#8220;white-box&#8221;) to curriculum understanding should be added as it could offer more wide and comprehensive understanding of psychological and sociological processes in Human interactions and relations to physical environment. The final goal is to make new form of disciplinary and interdisciplinary approcah as transformation of existing scientific school subject based curriculum which is used in most National School Systems. <\\/p>\\n<p>5.\\tHigher and long term goals in curriculum should be integrated into global (wide) curriculum organization of knowledge which could integrate scientific disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge into more Life-sense use and offer new experience of Life-long learning. Also basic principles of Life-long learning on the basis of MSA approach will be presented. <\\/p>\\n<p>6.\\tInclusive strategies for improved organization of school curriculum will be presented that could enable slow introduction of &#8220;child-centred&#8221; principles into classical &#8220;teacher-centred&#8221; schooling in the course of differences that were defined in UNESCO 2005. We can say also that inclusive principles can be slowly introduced into productivity and segregating classical curriculum. <\\/p>\\n<p>7.\\tPossible measures and efforts will be introduced to lower factography (too much unnecessary data) in school programs and replace unnecessary informations with more effective program knowledge to account children needs and consider internal motivation of learners.<br \\/>\\nProductivity, categorization, segregation, stigmatization\\u2026 as basic &#8220;Black-box&#8221; problems in actual National School Systems arround the World make school &#8220;knowledge&#8221; mostly inefficient as learners soon forget such a knowledge.

Men operate in gangs, groups, troops.  They make decisions together and get stuff done, even if they hardly know each other.  Gender division of labor is part of primate evolution.

The norms that prevail are the results of changes that had been established and differ from the current changes that are taking place.

The sequential learning of the alphabets and the whole word (from simple to complex) approach remains the best. It will be utterly confusing for such a child to grapple with the various sounds of the same letter unless such simple words are learnt holistic.

And for the teacher conducting a lesson has always been easy, without stress, because the teaching method was specifically designed for teachers with any level of training on this topic. From the many years of practice teaching this topic, it was concluded that every adult can and should contribute to HIV prevention.<br \\/>\\nWe must help the youth! Absolutely everyone can do it, regardless of financial condition. For example, even if a person simply shares this information that in international practice there are specific lessons on HIV \\/ AIDS prevention for high school students. And this person who shares this information will surely save the lives of several young people at once. These lessons have such power! And it&#8217;s always easy to check! Simply, children should get an opportunity to learn about the rules of survival in the modern world during the global HIV \\/ AIDS epidemic! But only on special lessons meant for them. Other chaotic information without tracking perception of the topic may not protect young people from the danger of infection.<br \\/>\\nDear parents and teachers! Take advantage of this opportunity for your children and teach them to protect themselves from HIV \\/ AIDS before they leave school. Do not be indifferent to the fact that your children can leave school without this special knowledge! Check out this situation with queries at the level of parent associations! After all, the state guarantees high school students such knowledge! The question is whether parents and teachers will be interested in these special lessons and will they want to use them!

That&#8217;s, at least, the image we get from this country in Latin America, well, on the everyday life there ( I spent 9 months living in Copenhagen) I was so disappointed to see how consumerism works when you can afford buying something new and getting rid of the last season&#8217;s couch, TV, shoes or whatever you wore just once and don&#8217;t need anymore.<br \\/>\\nI consider that societies in powerful and developed countries, where acces to education is not a problem, still lack this global education. The awareness, that not only by building thousends of windmills, you will compensate the pollution you generate every second of your life based on this (sometimes absurd) consumerism.

This means that at every grade level K-12 boys are competing with girls for grades who are at a minimum three years more mature than they are. This is a huge advantage yet it is seldom ever mentioned when the gender gap in education is being discussed. Why? Its inconceivable that educators are not aware of this maturity advantage girls have over boys. So the best and most likely reason is the powers that be like the status quo. <\\/p>\\n<p>Who would want girls to out perform boys?  certainly the women&#8217;s movement. How do we know.

Some Givernments have made provision of \\u2018 Education guarantee cards\\u2019 to facilitate admisdion from one school to another but many teachers are not even aware of this facility and those who are consider it as additional work and avoid preparing the document.

From June 2016 until November 2017, we founded and ran a school at Oinofyta camp. We counted with 5 classrooms and an average of 200 students.<br \\/>\\nIt was so great to see the children and adults in this harsh camp environment have a respite that our school provided. We taught children in the mornings and adults in the afternoon, five days per week.<br \\/>\\nWe taught English to many children and adults. We are so proud of their achievements and our volunteers&#8217; dedicated work. Please check us out.<br \\/>\\nSadly, in November 2017, the Greek government decided to close the camp. Our school had to close too.<br \\/>\\nWe are now, preparing the deployment of IT classrooms in suitcases and the provision of an e-curriculum to various educational projects along the European refugee route. We will be starting a pilot programme where three boxes will be deployed. <\\/p>\\n<p>Please check us out!<br \\/>\\n<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.armandoaid.org\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">https:\\/\\/www.armandoaid.org\\/<\\/a><br \\/>\\n<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/ArmandoAid\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/ArmandoAid\\/<\\/a><br \\/>\\nFollow us on instragram too:  <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/armando_aid\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/armando_aid\\/<\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>We are also planning to relocate our school in another camp and are raising funds for it. We run entirely through private donations and are a small organisation passionate about empowering refugee communities.<\\/p>\\n<p>We have so many stories to tell and one of them is about an 18 years old student from Afghanistan.<br \\/>\\nHe spent most of his childhood in Iran where he was denied an education.<br \\/>\\nWhen he arrived in Moria camp on Lesvos, he met his first English teacher. The camp&#8217;s authorities would not let, apart from a couple of official NGO&#8217;s anybody else in the camp.<br \\/>\\nSo, our student received his first English lessons through a fence for a 3 months.<br \\/>\\nHe arrived at our school with fairly good English and volunteered to be a teacher&#8217;s assistant. He also received English and Biology lessons with us in the afternoons.<br \\/>\\nRight now, he is in Switzerland and for the first time in his life, he will be seating his first formal exams and taking IGCSE English this summer.<br \\/>\\nThis bright young man, learned to speak fluently, two completely different languages, English and Greek.<br \\/>\\nHis English is enviable and soon he will be able to join University courses in Switzerland. We wish him great success.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2018\\/06\\/20\\/are-you-the-voice-of-refugees-on-education\\/#comment-21783","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/002c80a74612df0c1df0b195ab75cee1?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/002c80a74612df0c1df0b195ab75cee1?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/002c80a74612df0c1df0b195ab75cee1?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/002c80a74612df0c1df0b195ab75cee1?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/21783"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11765"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=21783"}]}},{"id":21750,"post":11746,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Pre Kg Admission","author_url":"http:\\/\\/www.chennaipublicschool.com\\/","date":"2018-06-29T15:25:12","date_gmt":"2018-06-29T13:25:12","content":{"rendered":"<p>No objection to this article.

Schools in rural areas are more venurables to abuse as reporting mechanisms for accountability, transparency and service delivery satisfaction are very minimal . Teachers absenteeism is still high, projects take more time to be completed or abandoned at all, some central governments have used rural schools as fertile places to grow ghost workers, ghost projects, teaching and learning materials are delivered to schools on paper but in reality nothing may have been delivered to these schools. This limited flow of information is negatively impacting on the quality of education.<br \\/>\\nShould government allow students and teachers engage in M learning, schools will not only improve in

earlier age? Where is the evidence to show that this is founded on good, solid research? I am a teacher and a majority of research studies that I have read show better outcomes with a later start. Notwithstanding that, I agree with a legal right to education from age 3, but I do not agree that it should be compulsory. France already has class sizes much larger than the average for this age group and has a very low investment per child. When will the changes take effect? How will they recruit and train 1000 additional teachers in time? It sounds to me like they may just implement \\u201con the job\\u201d training\\u2026i.e. put untrained people in classrooms. Who will support them, when the existing teachers are already stretched teaching big classes? There is some wording in these articles that suggests that it won\\u2019t be just play and that there could be plans for some sort of structured early reading\\/writing education. The neurobiology suggests that for the average child of this age, this may not be a good idea. For me, it is clear that this is not a decision taking on the grounds that this will result on better educational outcomes. My daughter already attends a French \\u201cmaternelle\\u201d class in France. There are 25 kids in her class \\u2013 mostly aged 4. There is one teacher and one assistant, who spends most of her time sticking notifications in the kids\\u2019 \\u201ccahiers\\u201d. There is a total lack of technology and investment to support these staff, We bring our daughter home for lunch as there are 60 kids who use the canteen, with just 2 assistants to supervise. In my opinion, the system isn\\u2019t working very well as it stands and it needs investment, rather than changes like this that do not seem to be based on any real evidence of better outcomes. There is a big difference between a legal right to education for every child from a certain age and making education compulsory from a certain age. Yes\\u2026.a small number of kids in the French overseas territories will possibly benefit, but what will be the effects for parents like us who want to travel for a month or two with our kids while they are young?<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2018\\/03\\/28\\/more-than-just-symbolism-france-makes-pre-primary-school-compulsory-from-age-3\\/#comment-20838","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3f3512da8a27e3e6b6b04fdd604eb1ce?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3f3512da8a27e3e6b6b04fdd604eb1ce?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3f3512da8a27e3e6b6b04fdd604eb1ce?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3f3512da8a27e3e6b6b04fdd604eb1ce?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/20838"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11620"}]}},{"id":20828,"post":11616,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Gabrielle Wills","author_url":"https:\\/\\/plus.google.com\\/107982836809707889254","date":"2018-03-29T08:11:24","date_gmt":"2018-03-29T06:11:24","content":{"rendered":"<p>But there are also unintended consequences of movements to foster &#8220;accountability&#8221;&#8230;.South Africa\\u2019s \\u2018Fees must fall\\u2019 protests ultimately led to political commitments to provide free higher education for the majority of students.

However, I find a great part of it unecessary negative downplaying such a decision. Indeed, by announcing to make education compulsory from age 3 France will at the same time make pre-primary education compulsory, that&#8217;s well beyond what the Education 2030 Framework for Action is asking countries to do (at least one year). In the context where pre-primary education is not compulsory in the majority of European countries even though there is a legal entitlment to it, having a developed country like France that is taking such a decision  should be greeted more. <\\/p>\\n<p>Yes, the decision is definively symbolic since most children of 3 years are enrolled already at this level on average. But, still it is an indication of the attention paid by Mr. Macron to education as said in the blog, but also to SDG Education 2030 agenda, a point that should have been stress as well. <\\/p>\\n<p>May be France is not making that much for pre-primary education compared with some EU countries.

By contrast, formerly colonial languages were written centuries ago and they tend to have older and complex spelling.  Also local languages may use simpler writing systems. <\\/p>\\n<p>The confusion is evident in the graph shown on Ethiopia.  Amharic and related languages are written in a syllabic script that has various complexities and takes 1-2 years to master.

This famous quote beautifully ignites our thought process to understand the importance of well nurtured minds in development. As included in UNs Sustainable Development Goals, obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people\\u2019s lives and sustainable development. The Society for Door Step Schools (DSS) believes in this vision and has been working on it since its inception in 1988-89 when it was founded in Mumbai, India by Mrs. Rajani Paranjpe and her ex-student Mrs. Bina Lashkari and expanded to Pune, India in 1993. It has been working with the aim of addressing illiteracy among the marginalized sections of society; by bringing education to the &#8220;Door Step&#8221; of these underprivileged children.<\\/p>\\n<p>Pune, a city with ample of job opportunities is considered as Oxford of the East due to its quality of education. Even in this educational hub of India, education of underprivileged children possesses a challenge. Only a small percentage of the children of migrant laborers attend school, the rest remain out of school because of various reasons &#8211; they need to stay at home to take care of the younger siblings, or schools are inaccessible or simply they can\\u2019t cope up with schools having stayed out of school for prolonged time. For addressing this issue DSS came up with an initiative called Every Child Counts \\u2013 A Citizens\\u2019 Campaign (ECC).<br \\/>\\nThe ECC model has unique methodology to identify out-of-school children and enroll them to school.<br \\/>\\nIn the first stage, mapping of the area is done, after mapping a systematic survey is conducted of each and every street in the city to cover Housing and road Construction sites, to identify temporary settlements, semi-permanent settlements to determine the presence of labor camps and children who are in the 6-7-year age group. Considering the vast population, ECC had a way out to include citizens in process. Involving citizens helped in reaching out to masses within less time. Citizen would survey the locality, identify out of school children between the age of 6 and 10, and collect the details. Given that the citizen volunteers had minimal experience in such surveys, the DSS teams help and monitor the survey. The next step is to map each site to the nearest school based on the list of schools, map location of the school obtained from school authorities.  Once children are located, parents are approached and counseled on the importance of education, informed of the nearest school and the process of getting the children enrolled into schools. Wherever children and parents have no exposure to the concept of schooling, the team starts &#8220;Preparatory camps&#8221; for the children. A temporary classroom is setup in a tent or a room provided by builders and children are introduced to the idea of schooling and learning. The children are taught basic hygiene and get used to sitting for a longer period, say their names, a few important phrases in the local language, making it easier for them to adjust in a bigger school with many children.<br \\/>\\nIn second stage, Enrollment and support: Sites with children identified during the survey phase are revisited before the start of the enrollment period and parents encouraged to visit the schools by themselves to enroll their children. A simple identity card called &#8220;My Card&#8221;, carrying details of the children and the name of the school is given to the parents to help them provide the required details to the school.<br \\/>\\nIn third stage Follow up: During this stage the campaign team with the help of volunteers monitors the progress of children by visiting sites and schools. Parents are educated on their role in getting involved in parent meetings and schooling. Other barriers to children attending school regularly such as lack of parental awareness, particularly among migrant parents, lack of safe transportation to school and school attitudes towards migrant children are addressed.<br \\/>\\nAs a result of structured efforts across programs in DSS, we can see that in 2012-13, 4270 children were identified and out of that 1757 (41.14%) children were enrolled to schools in Pune. This number increases significantly over the period and in last year i.e. 2016-2017 total 7185 children were identified, out of which 4221 (58.75%) children were enrolled to school. Since 2012-13, ECC has identified 30000+ out-of-school children and enrolled 16000+ children into mainstream schools in and around Pune city. The program is still continuing and has already enrolled 1500+ children in the current year. The same model is successfully implemented in IT Hub of India Bangalore with great results. Success of this model in city like Pune is a good example of high potential held by the model. ECC is contributing continuously towards UN\\u2019s goal and wish this model could be an inspiration for many like-minded people.<br \\/>\\n<a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.doorstepschool.org\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">http:\\/\\/www.doorstepschool.org<\\/a><\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/09\\/25\\/two-years-down-13-to-go-checking-in-on-our-progress-towards-the-sdgs\\/#comment-20077","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/ee5c977bbe2e1eb0c757af6e1e086a22?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/ee5c977bbe2e1eb0c757af6e1e086a22?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/ee5c977bbe2e1eb0c757af6e1e086a22?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/ee5c977bbe2e1eb0c757af6e1e086a22?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/20077"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10855"}]}}]'

I would like to bring to your attention a curious change that I have recently noticed. For many years, we have considered 20% as the benchmark to be reached by governments on their national education budgets. For example, the GPE Results Framework includes that target. The Education 2030 Framework for Action mentioned the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (2015), where the target was &#8220;at least 15% to 20%&#8221;. However, I noticed that the GME (page 23) reduced the target to &#8220;&#8230; minimum 15% threshold proposed in the Education 2030 Framework for Action (GPE, 2016a).&#8221; This GPE reference is the Policy Brief on &#8220;GPE\\u00b4s engagement on domestic financing for education&#8221;, where it is said, &#8220;Several countries are still far from reaching the internationally-set minimum education expenditure benchmark of 15 percent&#8221; (page 13). Therefore, there is a change from considering a benchmark of the 20%, to a target of 15% to 20%, and now a threshold of 15%. I don\\u00b4t know where this change is coming from, but I think this is a dangerous indication, as some governments could reduce their education budget following this new benchmark. I would like to know what do you think about this. Best wishes.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2018\\/02\\/09\\/what-next-for-the-global-partnership-for-education-after-a-transformative-replenishment\\/#comment-19973","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c721f6959ffec38f6cad9a0567571031?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c721f6959ffec38f6cad9a0567571031?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c721f6959ffec38f6cad9a0567571031?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c721f6959ffec38f6cad9a0567571031?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/19973"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11497"}]}},{"id":19958,"post":11493,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Helen Abadzi","author_url":"","date":"2018-02-08T19:42:38","date_gmt":"2018-02-08T18:42:38","content":{"rendered":"<p>Great blog!

Of course these are the views of the writer and I do not think so we all can agree on these ideas. The same events can be explained different ways through different perspectives. Only what I can say that the past event in the should be explained in the time of that period. Of course we can learn from the past.<br \\/>\\nFor me in the past we have conflict, its very difficult for me to name it as a civil war. It gives me different meaning, this may be because of my limited understanding. Again it could be the perspectives what we are using to explain the event.<br \\/>\\nIf we see the education development of the country in the past 15 years, we have achieved the remarkable gain the areas of expansion of schooling facilities, participation, increasing females and other disadvantaged groups in teaching positions. We should keep this in mind. But the gray area is in efficiency and quality of education. It was a right time to invest in quality and efficiency improvement but we were\\/are compelled to invest scarce resources on the development and maintenance of infrastructure which were damaged by the devastating earthquake.<br \\/>\\nTeaching forces in Nepal are highly influential in terms of political affiliation towards the political parties. I agree with the writer that if we blame only teacher for the low quality and efficiency it will be unfair to them. We all are responsible for this. There is a vicious circle of the graduates who are in teaching profession, the journey starts from school, then university, then job market, then profession, then work culture, then monitoring and accountability. In order to improve the quality of the graduates and make them accountable, we should consider all these aspects, not only those teachers who are in teaching profession.<br \\/>\\nThere are some schools who produces good results and highly attractive for many people. They are under the same policies, curriculum and monitoring system. So for me the most important thing is about the work culture. And politics is the overall for developing such culture. Let us hope that the forthcoming election will bring leaders with new visions and work culture who can guide us in the future where our children will have high quality education.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/11\\/17\\/accountability-in-education-in-post-conflict-nepal\\/#comment-18662","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d1ddfb49804b2c4cf531111e3cc608ee?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d1ddfb49804b2c4cf531111e3cc608ee?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d1ddfb49804b2c4cf531111e3cc608ee?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d1ddfb49804b2c4cf531111e3cc608ee?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/18662"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11223"}]}},{"id":18604,"post":11223,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Sushan Acharya","author_url":"","date":"2017-11-24T03:59:34","date_gmt":"2017-11-24T02:59:34","content":{"rendered":"<p>The blog is interesting but needs some reflections upon the blogger&#8217;s generalized view about teachers.  We, who are in Nepal, are also closely watching and in contact with schools and teachers directly or indirectly.  It was true that teachers were targeted as were other members of the public public for presumably taking the side of either the Maoists or the Army. Yes, there are teachers who did suffer and were victimized during the conflict. But the situation has changed a lot and many decisions in favor of teachers have been made during these past 10 years irrespective of their competence and political affiliation. One group is stronger as the other due to their affiliation with political parties. All the teacher unions\\/organizations are visibly sister organizations of political parties.   I wonder how the writer could be so deterministic when he said &#8220;Don\\u2019t blame teachers, blame the politicisation of education\\u201d.  Yes it is politicization &#8211; but who is politicizing? And politicization just doesn&#8217;t happen. People are involved in this act. <\\/p>\\n<p>Therefore let&#8217;s not be abstract here. The writer has very carefully omitted the role of political parties, who are mobilizing teachers and most teachers are loyal (accountable) to them. If the politicization was for education it would do good.  But the politicization is done for personal and party benefits. In other words utter &#8216;balkanization&#8217;.  Nevertheless, the Teacher Federation has been talking about quality education. It has been organizing training for teachers, organizing interaction programs, etc.  But we have not seen satisfactory results from all these initiatives in terms of the learning achievement of community school children. <\\/p>\\n<p>Right now, the ninth amendment of the Education Act is an example of keeping all the incompetent teachers in the system.  The amendment has proposed internal examination of 75% of the temporary teachers. And only 25% of seats are allocated for free competition.  This clearly restricts good people to enter the system and give continuity to the same burnt out and incompetent teachers.  It is crystal clear.  The 8th amendment was not even implemented before they brought the 9th amendment. It was done in agreement with all the major parties. After only a few days of the formation of the High Level Education Commission this decision was made. The Commission had not even started its work the amendment came. Two of the renowned educationists immediately resigned from the Commission. Now our education students are in protest against the amendment. But the teachers unions are very happy. Despite the debate, protest which was in the newspapers every day, teachers lobbied and got the President to endorse the Act.  The teachers\\u2019 leaders were requested not to do it and rather to ask the President to have the 8th amendment (in which there was a clause for the Teacher Commission to announce vacancy periodically so that many young people who possess teaching license could get opportunity to compete for teaching jobs). They didn&#8217;t listen.  Then a group of lawyers filed a writ against the amendment, which they claim is against the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has not yet made any decision.  <\\/p>\\n<p>Therefore it is not a straight game BUT what is true is that there are community schools that are doing really well, despite the teachers&#8217; political affiliation and political parties&#8217; pressure. How is this possible? Again all because of committed head teachers and management committees and also committed teachers.  How is it possible? Why were these few not influenced or affected by &#8216;politicization&#8217;? <\\/p>\\n<p>So, as the writer also hints, the issue and situation need to be viewed and analyzed in context, and should not be generalized as the writer himself has done.  Please see- <a href=\\"http:\\/\\/www.edukhabar.com\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow ugc\\">http:\\/\\/www.edukhabar.com\\/<\\/a> , tcmd.org (teachers can make a difference) for how and why a good community school could be good, and how and why another school with same resources and under the same legal provisions couldn&#8217;t do well.   But these websites are in Nepali language &#8211;  sorry about that!<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/11\\/17\\/accountability-in-education-in-post-conflict-nepal\\/#comment-18604","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c0e5aac28ecd5ecb1c08640c6a69fcc1?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c0e5aac28ecd5ecb1c08640c6a69fcc1?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c0e5aac28ecd5ecb1c08640c6a69fcc1?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c0e5aac28ecd5ecb1c08640c6a69fcc1?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/18604"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11223"}]}},{"id":18579,"post":11249,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"KhaulaRiz","author_url":"http:\\/\\/khaulariz.wordpress.com","date":"2017-11-22T12:29:39","date_gmt":"2017-11-22T11:29:39","content":{"rendered":"<p>Hello, <\\/p>\\n<p>I am interested in submitting a blog about the status of Pakistan\\u2019s education and technology.

Nobody wants to unduly penalize teachers working under difficult conditions but teacher absenteeism is a critical factor in the education delivery equation untracked by most governments. In Africa, as elsewhere we are aware that teacher absenteeism varies from being manageable (&lt;19%) to being alarming (25-35%) (Mozambique, Uganda among others). These\\u00a0are\\u00a0actually\\u00a0conservative\\u00a0 estimates of\\u00a0absence,as teachers may be present but not actually teaching in the classroom and this would push the rates \\u00a0considerably\\u00a0higher.\\u00a0\\u00a0A 2009 World Bank study in Zambia indicates that  a 5 per cent increase in the absence rate of teachers reduced learning by 4-8 percent of the average gains during the year .

With these issues in mind, Program4Results with Saltracker, has developed a teacher attendance management system which provides panoptic reporting on both teacher and learner daily attendance via a mobile app designed to be both on and off line. The incentive for teachers to participate is that in addition to this EMIS tool which supports the school head in a variety of ways, the app provides teacher development through an LMS on key subject materials which are conveyed and individually monitored by the time a teacher spends on subject related activities and knowledge quizzes. This builds the teachers knowledge and provides lesson plans for teaching difficult topics. Learning deficits are identified and can be addressed. An additional incentive is that a teacher can earn &quot;factokens&quot; by being registered as in attendance and by time spent on LMS activities which can be exchanged for study leave, performance merits or anything the Ministry decides upon. Promising results are indicated in two pilot studies.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/11\\/09\\/punishing-teachers-is-often-counter-productive\\/#comment-18358","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/33a84fe71e30deb065af0aee718e21dc?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/33a84fe71e30deb065af0aee718e21dc?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/33a84fe71e30deb065af0aee718e21dc?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/33a84fe71e30deb065af0aee718e21dc?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/18358"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11159"}]}}]'

But it is good to state that these are self-reported reasons, and it&#8217;s useful to question self-serving excuses.   Those absent get you to the wrong conclusions, i.e. don&#8217;t blame teachers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Research shows robust results from significant and enforceable sanctions.  UNESCO did not like the idea, but that does not invalidate it.  If you don&#8217;t show up at your office and don&#8217;t do what you are asked, you are like to face some sanctions &#8211; unless you are a political appointee.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nevertheless, one big reason is missing:  cognitive difficulty, inability to deal with the content or manage the class, that may have 70-90 students.   Also the boredom of repetitiveness.  Teachers in public schools of poor countries often struggle to bring into working memory content to answer questions or ask good ones, to spot mistakes in students&#8217; calculations, or to deal with endless noise.  This may be one big reason why teachers get appointed and quickly go on study leave.  This learning deficit is perhaps manageable.  But someone must spot it and manage it.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/11\\/09\\/punishing-teachers-is-often-counter-productive\\/#comment-18287","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/18287"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/11159"}]}},{"id":18252,"post":11152,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"H.

Scores of variables are reported, some more relevant than others.<\\/p>\\n<p> The schools given to private providers seem to be well below the Liberian average. TIMSS sample test items and words per minute suggest that.  The USAID scores were 8-10 wpm higher either as treatment or as control than the scores of the private providers (or their controls).  see p. 82, table H.1, for example. This makes scores hard to compare with those of earlier measures that were more representative of the country.<\\/p>\\n<p>Contractor schools seem to have better student attendance, but they were chosen to be 4 minutes away from the rd. rather than 24.  Contractors constrained the numbers of students in classes and did not want to go to remote areas.  If governments had the same option, they would be performing much better.<\\/p>\\n<p>Some variables related to memory and consolidation had effects.  For example, student attendance was much higher in some contractors than others.  a 30% vs. 56% attendance for example would raise expectations for greater long-term retention, assuming the class taught some links in the chain needed to read.  But many differences with control schools in various situations were statistically but not practically significant. Do 2 words per minute justify management change when students only read 15 wpm?  And the counterfactual is really not known. Contractors in most cases did not report those.<\\/p>\\n<p>Overall, the benefits and hassles of using contractors to teach literacy through English are confused and modest.

PAL may be showing its statistical prowess, but this does not help.  Results are in terms of standard deviation units rather than words per minute or some other concrete metric.  Students should be reading 45 words per minute at least in order to make sense of the text.  So it&#8217;s unclear whether the benefits of the private schools translate into ability to learn information from texts.<br \\/>\\nReported data include the Stallings classroom snapshot, so we see info on what the teacher was doing.  Private teachers were more likely to be in the school and in the class, and more likely to engage in &#8216;active&#8217; vs. &#8216;passive&#8217; instruction.  So, students are getting more instructional time, and they have on average a few more books.  They should be performing better, therefore.<br \\/>\\nSome providers also replaced most teachers, and one of them has 60% new teachers.  We all want to see bad teachers go, but the crux is qualified replacements. And will they stay? young people may teach for a while and leave for better opportunities.  The program is being evaluated for short-term effects, and it&#8217;s unclear what the long-term effects will be.  Supervision matters a great deal, and it&#8217;s also expensive.  The data are unclear about the incidence of supervisors.<br \\/>\\nThe data do not show how the complex English spelling is taught and how much reading practice students get.  This is what matters.  And frankly, there are very good interventions in Liberia for that. A few years ago Marcia Davidson spent 2-3 years for USAID developing a very detailed reading program with scripted lessons for Liberian English that gave very good outcomes.  Why has that fallen into disuse and when did private providers develop a similar program?  How do they teach English spelling?  All that is unclear.<br \\/>\\nSometimes money and public relations obscure the substance.

You are right to say that as a literature review, the report responds to the assessments that are out there and therefore leaves gaps where there are gaps in the literature.

The two are not mutually exclusive and improving literacy assessments is necessary to provide the information policy makers need to make good decisions on the language of instruction.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/06\\/16\\/literacy-assessments-the-importance-of-reading-with-understanding\\/#comment-16188","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/558b4f625927445197aebc20b1732ba2?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/558b4f625927445197aebc20b1732ba2?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/558b4f625927445197aebc20b1732ba2?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/558b4f625927445197aebc20b1732ba2?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/16188"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10331"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/15718"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=16188"}]}},{"id":16179,"post":10427,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Anderson Miamen","author_url":"","date":"2017-07-11T16:47:31","date_gmt":"2017-07-11T14:47:31","content":{"rendered":"<p>Reading the above tributes, I join others to mourn his passing.

It is one which I and colleagues in language in development education feel we need to make again and again until it is taken on board. I take no issue with the very proper matters which the post deals with in respect of the teaching and assessment of reading; they have been the bread and butter of the teaching of initial reading for decades. However, a more fundamental question is: are children learning to read in &#8211; and then continuing to get their education through &#8211; a language which they speak well. Many, throughout the developing world are not. The fact that this is the case puts a low ceiling on what they can learn and grossly depresses their educational achievement. Low school achievement as a consequence of, quite simply, not understanding the content of lessons, is very widespread, very damaging to the education of individuals and very probably a key factor in the failure of developing countries to grow economically at the rate they they should. It is often this more than anything else which accounts for poor reading ability levels. Medium of instruction is a first-order issue: it undermines &#8211; or facilitates &#8211; everything else. NGOs and aid agencies all over the developing world, however, are only just waking up to this issue and ministries are largely still blind to it. We need as a matter of urgency to face this language question and get it right, Only then can we move towards thinking about the very important matters which this blog is concerned with.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/06\\/16\\/literacy-assessments-the-importance-of-reading-with-understanding\\/#comment-15718","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/15718"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10331"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=15718"}]}},{"id":15695,"post":10323,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Wendy","author_url":"http:\\/\\/chinchi87.wordpress.com","date":"2017-06-15T12:36:14","date_gmt":"2017-06-15T10:36:14","content":{"rendered":"<p>With so many adults seeking education and knowing the process, how is it there are unsurmountable barriers for those trying to learn?

We often think of greater access to education as being important to economic growth and workforce development. These are real and important issues. However greater access to education is also an important factor for increasing political inclusion and for creating a more constructive social and political dialogue in the society. We have seen in several countries, and recently lately in the USA, the divisive effect that a significant segment of the population that has not benefited from educational resources can have on the political situation and a country&#8217;s international stature. With national educational levels being of increasing importance to the ability of the state to compete in a globalized world, local differences in access to education also give rise to different world views among the population. Improving access to education is a state&#8217;s responsibility to its communities, its national interests, and its international neighbors.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/05\\/16\\/inclusive-higher-education-in-south-africa-not-just-a-policy-project-but-also-an-ethical-project\\/#comment-15078","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/db4faae643702784a995340ba2f98ece?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/db4faae643702784a995340ba2f98ece?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/db4faae643702784a995340ba2f98ece?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/db4faae643702784a995340ba2f98ece?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/15078"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10194"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=15078"}]}},{"id":15077,"post":10153,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Heseg","author_url":"http:\\/\\/www.xn----zhcdjajnmhc4duf.co.il\\/","date":"2017-05-16T12:04:30","date_gmt":"2017-05-16T10:04:30","content":{"rendered":"<p>So cute. thanks!<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/05\\/10\\/and-the-winners-of-our-youth-photo-competition-are\\/#comment-15077","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6020d956d7d8f8ca08d6d807a7b34ce8?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6020d956d7d8f8ca08d6d807a7b34ce8?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6020d956d7d8f8ca08d6d807a7b34ce8?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/6020d956d7d8f8ca08d6d807a7b34ce8?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/15077"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10153"}]}},{"id":14998,"post":10153,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Millennium@EDU","author_url":"","date":"2017-05-11T06:41:07","date_gmt":"2017-05-11T04:41:07","content":{"rendered":"<p>Reblogged this on <a href=\\"http:\\/\\/millenniumedu.org\\/2017\\/05\\/11\\/and-the-winners-of-our-youth-photo-competition-are\\/\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Millennium@EDU SUSTAINABLE EDUCATION<\\/a> and commented:<br \\/>\\n3 winners of our youth photo competition around the themes of #SDG4.7<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/05\\/10\\/and-the-winners-of-our-youth-photo-competition-are\\/#comment-14998","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/07e72b31014233e338115a5f40ca5410?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/14998"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10153"}]}}]'

It&#8217;s also important to evaluate what kind of affirmative actions to take, in order to make them fair to all. Race and class are big factors here, but they are also limited and they may take opportunities from others who are disadvantaged and more qualified. I was told in Ethiopia, to introduce an affirmative action to increase female enrollment in higher education, they lowered the cutting point of admission exam for female students and as a result, many female students who were not prepared to study at the university level enrolled and could not perform well and eventually dropped out. And how do male students feel, who perform in the admission exam better than female students but could not enroll?  I think rather than lowering the standard, it is more important to provide remedial courses or preparatory courses to help them meet the same standard as others.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2017\\/05\\/01\\/growing-demand-for-higher-education-puts-affirmative-action-in-the-spotlight\\/#comment-14881","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3aae4468349c7e8e3d4a0c5415f45cd9?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3aae4468349c7e8e3d4a0c5415f45cd9?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3aae4468349c7e8e3d4a0c5415f45cd9?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/3aae4468349c7e8e3d4a0c5415f45cd9?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/14881"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/10104"}]}},{"id":14876,"post":9936,"parent":14676,"author":0,"author_name":"Stanfill","author_url":"http:\\/\\/www.seancody.com","date":"2017-05-01T16:55:47","date_gmt":"2017-05-01T14:55:47","content":{"rendered":"<p>Not good at all.

What they learned and taught were based on the realities. There were no outside elements to determine agendas for them. All these were in keeping with the present day SDG. In fact, all traditional religious practices and stories related to the religious norms contained the current day principles of SDG. Thus, for example,  Buddhist philosophy contains stories of the previous births of Lord Buddha which were conveyed through sermons to the laity by the priests  regularly and continued to date. The Afghans are great story tellers. So are other cultures all of which had centuries of homegrown literature with full of stories containing good deeds and behaviors of man. The indigenous populations in Asia, Australia, and elsewhere in the world had great respect to fauna and flora ( well-known speech of the Chief of Seattle ). Hence, SDGs were well followed,  observed and respected by one and all, least exploiting the nature and polluting the same. Hence what is urgently needed is to study these valuable lessons and practices and use the same amongst the communities rather than look for alien actions and lessons.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/08\\/09\\/promoting-indigenous-knowledge-within-the-sustainable-development-agenda\\/#comment-14293","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d774734ea8effe56f2cfb33bbd1935c4?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d774734ea8effe56f2cfb33bbd1935c4?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d774734ea8effe56f2cfb33bbd1935c4?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/d774734ea8effe56f2cfb33bbd1935c4?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/14293"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/7990"}]}},{"id":14292,"post":6995,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Dr.S.B.Ekanayake","author_url":"https:\\/\\/sbekanayake.blogspot.com","date":"2017-03-01T13:23:00","date_gmt":"2017-03-01T12:23:00","content":{"rendered":"<p>It is true that English is more or less the lingua franca of many nations today.

It is a source of unending frustration for those of us concerned with levels of ability in the medium of instruction, that this issue is not taken up by ministries, publishers, teacher-educators, NGOs and even websites such as this one. The content of the textbook is important, but it is actually a second-order question. The ability to read it is a first-order question. We must pay more attention to this.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/12\\/15\\/out-of-date-textbooks-put-sustainable-development-at-risk\\/#comment-13122","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/13122"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/9100"}]}},{"id":13121,"post":3981,"parent":13120,"author":0,"author_name":"Kate Redman","author_url":"","date":"2016-12-15T10:41:22","date_gmt":"2016-12-15T09:41:22","content":{"rendered":"<p>Dear nicole, It was written by the GEM Report (or GMR as we were known at the time).

There are also obvious benefits to keeping it simple by focusing on core, age-appropriate literacy and numeracy skills within a set of common metrics that will produce internationally comparable data \\u2013 although here I imagine that many low income countries will still encounter significant difficulties in survey design, data collection and subsequently transforming that data into useful pedagogic tools that can be used by teachers to advance learning. After all, this is what it\\u2019s all about.<br \\/>\\nOr maybe not\\u2026.<\\/p>\\n<p>The essential point I was getting at is that children need to feel recognition and validation for what they can do, their skills, creativity and talents, not just what they know. And we should do more to make more children feel validated by the years they spend in schooling. Many public exam systems accross the world are not set up to do that. Recognition  can be a great confidence builder and sets children up to aim higher and go further.<\\/p>\\n<p>Again, as you mention, many of the skills now needed to get ahead are acquired elsewhere and fall outside of the conventional box of schooling.

Thank you for sharing with the world the challenges and obstacles that young girls and women encounter in pursuit of an education.

I imagine that these gentlemen will come from all aspects of a young girl\\u2019s life.  In other words, the collaboration to protect a girl child and provide her with opportunities for education should emerge from her father, brothers, and male teachers to male leaders in the community who witness such atrocities against these young children.  As someone who became a teenage mom at 16 years old, I can attest to the value of having not only strong women but men as well (my high school male teachers) who rose to the occasion to make sure that I completed my education.  As a result, I have obtained a bachelor\\u2019s and master\\u2019s degree, and am now working on my doctoral degree.  None of this would have been possible without the assistance of the community, and school leaders, three of which were men.

I would like to call attention to a point you made that could easily get lost: &#8220;The second issue involves the importance of knowing about the CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC CONTEXT in which assessments are carried out so as to improve how we interpret differences within and between countries.&#8221;<\\/p>\\n<p>Serious consideration of languages and world views is not only for interpretation of results&#8211;  it is for assessment itself. Testing in a language that learners do not speak or understand well, especially if their teachers are in a similar situation, is a big waste of time and resources, and I would say does more harm than good, because it causes people to believe that learning can only be communicated and assessed in dominant languages. &#8220;Serious consideration&#8221; means actually translating assessments into appropriate languages (as Ethiopia does, for example, on its national grade 4 and grade 8 assessments depending on the &#8220;nationality language&#8221; used as medium of instruction&#8211; see e.g. Heugh et al 2011) and ensuring that those translations use the appropriate terminology as well as illustrations\\/examples that are comprehensible in learners&#8217; contexts. This requires back-translating and piloting so that the instruments actually assess the intended content. (Since this is done on &#8220;standardized testing&#8221; in high-income countries, why would we not insist on the same standards?)<\\/p>\\n<p>Where learners&#8217; own languages are not used for teaching and learning, I would argue that NO assessment can be valid, because it will mainly assess the ability to memorize (in the case of curriculum-based testing) and\\/or luck (in the case of general skills testing). Needless to say, this is highly unfair to individual learners, as well as to schools and to school systems.<\\/p>\\n<p>I feel that cross-national assessments do to curriculum what the push for universal access did to quality&#8211; put the cart before the horse. Why not work toward quality teaching and learning first, then worry about getting children into (good) schools?

I think that these processes need to be open, transparent, and in some sense a construct of many stakeholders. On the other hand, I think that there needs to be some institutional home to provide continuity, brokering, etc. That blog has some ideas.

It is through monitoring that planners, managers, implementer, donors are able to acquire the information and understanding they need to make changes needed or make informed decisions about programs progress.

Monitoring and evaluation together provide the necessary data to guide strategic planning, to design and implement programs and to allocate, and re-allocate resources in better ways. It is through evaluation that donor can determine what kind of scholarships produce more successful. Much can be learned from monitoring and evaluation that can help donors or managers understand better whether scholarship or programs are leading to expected results.

Millions and probably billions of dollars have been wasted as no-one was monitoring or measuring or setting targets for attainment. From the outset the SDG&#8217;s\\/ GEM Report have indicated that the benchmarks being set are impossible to hit, in the hope that, &#8220;we shoot for the stars and hit the moon.&#8221; We have accepted that the targets are unlikely to be reached before we even start, an own goal in my view, a way out for donors and governments.  The GEM Report discusses the importance of managing education data and measuring improvements, and on-going assessment to improve teaching and learning. Yet donors and governments, and others responsible for delivering SDG&#8217;s4 will not have plausible, achievable targets themselves, to be judged by and be accountable for.<br \\/>\\nThe reality is, that we (so called first world) cannot afford to pay for what is so desperately needed around the world; increase educational standards, improve attainment, investment, create jobs, build economies and raise families out of poverty, thereby providing a more secure world for everyone. It is either not possible or we are not willing to pay. So we need to look at things differently, by asking what can we afford to do?<br \\/>\\nFor me, Universal Primary Education, and &#8220;no-one left behind&#8221; is all very good and idealistic (it is what I wanted as much as anyone), but it does not look like people are prepared to pay for it. What is needed is a more pragmatic approach, one I have never seen discussed but I think it needs to be said. If we cannot afford to educate all, then we need to be able to educate fewer, to a better standard. These then become the engineers, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs of the future. Imagine 15 years go, had we focused on some rather than all, but on 50% &#8211; and taken them all the way through to secondary education for free, where we might be now? Or 30% through to university? The situation is running out of control, if it isn&#8217;t already. Nothing is changing, in fact it looks like it might be getting worse. We need to change, not keep reproducing the same kinds of reports.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/09\\/13\\/why-have-countries-committed-to-development-targets-they-might-never-reach\\/#comment-12415","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5435d113bb94f2d458b7d7635f8b4541?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5435d113bb94f2d458b7d7635f8b4541?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5435d113bb94f2d458b7d7635f8b4541?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/5435d113bb94f2d458b7d7635f8b4541?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/12415"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/8191"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=12415"}]}},{"id":12414,"post":8211,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Jean Bernard","author_url":"","date":"2016-09-15T15:13:07","date_gmt":"2016-09-15T13:13:07","content":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you for making Mundiya Kapanga&#8217;s wisdom heard around the world.

Little has been done nothing to monitor this finding in successive EFA GMR reports, despite protests from the disability NGOs.  UNESCO regretted the absence of data while collecting revealing data on gender, poverty and urban-rural differences.<br \\/>\\nOptimism that disability-disaggregated would be included in the monitoring of SDG4 on education was created by a very strong UN General Assembly resolution and also by a commitment from the UIS that such data would be included in future.<br \\/>\\nThe 2016 GEM report is in many ways a great improvement on its predecessors in at least including disability in a section on equity but doesn&#8217;t even mention out of school children: here is the relevant paragraph:<\\/p>\\n<p>&#8220;Determining progress on equal access to education for people with disabilities requires an internationally comparable measure of disability, yet disability takes diverse forms. By one measure, across 30 education systems in Europe, 3.7% of compulsory education pupils were identified as having a special educational need in 2010. UNICEF and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics are leading efforts to develop an operational measure of disability. It is also important to monitor whether educators are well prepared and school infrastructure adapted to address the needs of learners with disabilities\\u201d.<br \\/>\\nI think the millions of  children still out of school deserve better than this and that the international community needs to take it more seriously. Much hope was pinned on the Oslo Summit because UNICEF and other organisations made a submission  on disability-disaggregated data Gordon Brown, the Global Envoy was well briefed.<br \\/>\\nThe UN Human Rights Commission has a complaints procedure for &#8216;grave and systemic discrimination&#8217;  by Member States.

However, our challenge is that of resources so as to reach as many people as possible. Our country is also faced with one of the highest numbers of HIV-AIDS, a situation worsened by gender based violence. Please if there is a donor out there willing to partner with us may we know. We have written a proposal on the activities and timelines we wish to undertake and the anticipated outcomes in behaviour change. We can submit it for consideration, if asked, by potential partners. Thank you and please get in touch, together we can make a positive change.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2015\\/11\\/25\\/school-related-gender-based-violence-impedes-gender-equality\\/#comment-12294","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/47d4ea719ff36e8cd44022658a44f5c4?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/47d4ea719ff36e8cd44022658a44f5c4?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/47d4ea719ff36e8cd44022658a44f5c4?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/47d4ea719ff36e8cd44022658a44f5c4?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/12294"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/6370"}]}},{"id":12260,"post":2581,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Aamer Malik","author_url":"","date":"2016-08-23T07:04:37","date_gmt":"2016-08-23T05:04:37","content":{"rendered":"<p>This data can be very helpful for the particular Governments, policy makers and practitioners, so that they can divert the resources for the girl\\u2019s education and take it on their first priority.

Like the other responses above, I agree that credentialing is absolutely essential and that online education cannot and should not replace the social experiences of attending a physical institution, I do wonder how organizations and global policy can balance these needs especially when host country governments may have restrictive policies about what kinds of online education they will recognize officially. For instance, some countries hosting Syrian refugees in the region do not recognize online higher education especially if the online components require students learning more than 50% of the course requirements online. This creates a dissonance between the needs of students and communities, what is available globally, outside an existing system, and what they can finally avail within an existing system given host country policies.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/05\\/24\\/virtually-educated-the-case-for-and-conundrum-of-online-higher-education-for-refugees\\/#comment-11716","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b4316099745816ba47c73bd38c9e7cec?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b4316099745816ba47c73bd38c9e7cec?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b4316099745816ba47c73bd38c9e7cec?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/b4316099745816ba47c73bd38c9e7cec?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/11716"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/7562"}]}},{"id":11708,"post":7639,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Ray Harris","author_url":"http:\\/\\/rayharris57.wordpress.com","date":"2016-05-30T12:51:10","date_gmt":"2016-05-30T10:51:10","content":{"rendered":"<p>foundations of pre-primary education should also get the share of investment otherwise losses will be felt later on.Children whose mother tongue is not the language of instruction, may start to fail by the third year in primary -do we think they will stay in school and move easily into secondary?<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/05\\/30\\/some-donors-are-shifting-aid-to-secondary-education\\/#comment-11708","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/be826caada6463738040d9068e6f563d?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/be826caada6463738040d9068e6f563d?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/be826caada6463738040d9068e6f563d?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/be826caada6463738040d9068e6f563d?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/11708"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/7639"}]}},{"id":11698,"post":7562,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Benjamin","author_url":"","date":"2016-05-29T18:09:29","date_gmt":"2016-05-29T16:09:29","content":{"rendered":"<p>Thanks for this very interesting post Martha!

Males have been set up by evolution to coalesce in tightly knit groups that have hunting or military goals.  Throughout the ages they could thus feed families.  Women are set up to marry the victors and maximize the chance that their children will survive.  Men feel great belonging to tightly knit groups, and doing military operations somehow feels right.  Women feel somehow that that these are the right men to marry.<\\/p>\\n<p>This behavior has been linked to Islam, but this is not the only example.  Consider the Central American gangs.  They operate on the same evolutionary principles but they have no profound rationale other than feeling good and getting money.  And women go along with that.<\\/p>\\n<p>One likely fuel for the events that we see has been the decades-long escalation in TV and videogame violence.  Young males see dozens of murders a day as well as weapons pointed at them.  With the adaptive imitation ability that our brains have, they learn what to do.  Various studies have raised concerns.  But though verbal violence seems to have risen in general as a result of TV violence, actual performance seems to involve only a minority; perhaps those of higher testosterone levels.  So, researchers have been ignored.<\\/p>\\n<p>One way to reduce the complex military attacks would be to reduce violence exposure. Given its links to evolutionary dictates, there should be international conventions to ban such content.  But we know that this will not happen.  So, what we see nowadays may only be the beginning, as cohort after cohort learns the craft of violence from cradle.<\\/p>\\n<p>One phenomenon that has been hard to understand has been the suicidal bombers. But Moslems are not the only ones.  In recent history there had been Japanese kamikazi and Tamil bombers. This practice reveals a tendency for young men to sacrifice themselves so that their relatives&#8217; DNA will live on. Similarly, social insects sacrifice themselves so that their hive will live.  Somehow the Islamic practices used make this trait reliably emerge in many young males.  <\\/p>\\n<p>So, in the 21st century we look for rational explanations, and we see that our genetic behavior tendencies are running circles around us.  Much thought is needed on how to neutralize destructive genetic tendencies. It&#8217;s useful to understand the dictates of evolutionary psychology and take measures.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/04\\/04\\/learning-from-former-extremists\\/#comment-11270","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/60ae1d5f6a1c8573397d974d958b0a03?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/11270"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/7283"}]}},{"id":11248,"post":7124,"parent":11105,"author":0,"author_name":"Daw Khin May Htwe","author_url":"","date":"2016-03-31T10:34:28","date_gmt":"2016-03-31T08:34:28","content":{"rendered":"<p>i am reading again and again<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/03\\/08\\/gender-bias-is-rife-in-textbooks\\/#comment-11248","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f7700f18de2130f597e0faeec62451dc?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f7700f18de2130f597e0faeec62451dc?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f7700f18de2130f597e0faeec62451dc?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/f7700f18de2130f597e0faeec62451dc?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/11248"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/7124"}],"in-reply-to":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/11105"}]}},{"id":11246,"post":7124,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Dr.Soe Moe Aung (Myanmar)","author_url":"","date":"2016-03-31T06:31:05","date_gmt":"2016-03-31T04:31:05","content":{"rendered":"<p>I am very interested in this.

It arose from Dutch in the 1600-1700 through intermarriages with natives and other immigrants.  For many, particularly the &#8216;Cape colored,&#8217; it has been the home language.  In the rebellion, the blacks demanded use of English, which was linked to the higher-status British who also did not like apartheid.  They did not demand Zulu, Xhosa, etc.<br \\/>\\nIronically, the south Africans got a mixed bag with English.  It is an outlier orthography whose spelling system takes 3 years to learn and brings out dyslexia in the brains of susceptible people.  It also needs many teaching resources and training.  By contrast Africaans (and all the African languages) are spelled consistently, so basic reading can be learned in 4 months or so.<br \\/>\\nThe best way for South Africans to learn English is to become fluent readers in one of the African languages (including Africaans, which dropped most of the earlier Dutch irregularities.)   The government has made this point and teaches in 11 languages.  But many people want the mark of status early on.

But the donor agencies confuse multiple variables and unfortunately give poor advice about &#8216;mother tongue&#8217; instruction.  <\\/p>\\n<p>Language issues must be disentangled from orthography.  The trouble with English, French, Portuguese is orthographic complexity.  It takes 3 years to teach English spelling and 100 days to teach in transparent orthographies.  And complex orthographies may bring out dyslexia in the brains of susceptible people. <\\/p>\\n<p> Students at risk must learn reading in a transparent orthography.  This advantage trumps language, as several neurocognitive studies have shown (see one by Perfetti, just a few days old at SSSR(.<\\/p>\\n<p>Low-income children in Liberia, for example, may speak liberian English best.  But it is probably more efficient to teach them reading in a local language like Kpele that they may not know.  Then transfer to English past automaticity, which the English orthography can be taught most efficiently.<\\/p>\\n<p>Also, are speakers of other languages permanently at a disadvantage?  We tend to make this decision from our own adult perspectives. The blanket advice to teach in &#8216;mother&#8217; tongues ignores the facility with which children up to age 8 or so acquire more than one.  Many Africans are multilingual.  So, is it worth making an all-out effort to teach in the 36 or so languages of Uganda?  Or is it ok to teach in 4 regional ones?  (all are transparently spelled).  <\\/p>\\n<p>This question begs for research-based answers.  The donors have never commissioned (to the best of my knowledge) any studies on how children&#8217;s  language knowledge evolves, when they learn it from environmental interactions.  How many words do they learn per month,how fast do they comprehend?   Without such data, we should not be advising governments.<\\/p>\\n<p>This blog should furthermore be advocating for targeted research to answer these questions.

Why?<\\/p>\\n<p>Imagine that you live at the end of a long, winding footpath. It leads to a paved road 1 km away. From there you can catch a bus to go to stores that sell anything you want.  But you must somehow learn to find your way to the road, step by step.  And you must walk at a reasonable speed, before night falls. <\\/p>\\n<p>Imagine that a wealthy donor hears of your need to get to the stores and sends you a nice car.  The car cannot get to your house.  The footpath is too narrow!  A donor may spend a billion $$ to send cars to take all rural residents to big cities. But those living along footpaths must still walk to a road wide enough for the cars to cross.  The richer ones may get to the cars faster by horse, but the road is still the same.  If the donor evaluates the utility of the cars without thinking of the footpath to be traversed, the results will be zero.<\\/p>\\n<p>Our neuronal circuits work that way.  Few connections can be made at a time, so for beginning readers the pathways are narrow.  They must decode letter by letter and get much practice in order to decode faster.  As they do, the visual word form area gets activated, that recognizes words as if they were faces. Then reading becomes effortless, automatic. This brain area enables fast transport to the stores of knowledge.

However, a first order issue is whether the textbooks can be read by learners and therefor used in the classroom. In countries in which learners learn in a second language (L2), and have low ability in that language, textbooks are often unreadable and thus unused. The textbooks are normally written as if they were intended for native speakers of the language; learners have nothing like the L2 reading ability they need to understand them and teachers therefore do not use the books. This is the case for example in Rwanda where research by the British Council shows books in primary schools, while supplied to schools, remaining unused. Research in Rwanda by the University of Bristol shows that textbooks used in grade 4 &#8211; the first year of English-medium schooling &#8211; are designed for native speakers and have a readability score, amongst native speaker readers, of well above grade four. Low-L2 ability readers cannot therefore read them. Research in Tanzania shows similar results. Experience generally in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) shows that textbooks are published as if designed for native speakers and demonstrate none of the characteristics which they should show if designed for L2 users. In addition, in SSA learner reading ability in L2 is widely shown to be low: Uwezo evidence for 2013 shows that in Uganda for example, fewer than 4 in 10 children aged 10-16 years display literacy skills at a Grade 2 level. Other evidence in SSA shows that reading events in the classroom are in general rare: learners are thus not being asked to read. A combination of few opportunities to read, low reading ability in L2 and textbooks which are unreadable is a significant matter which will result in books remaining unused. It is important to improve textbook supply (as is notably the case in Rwanda), but improvements in this respect are wasted if learners (and often teachers) cannot read the textbooks and if, as a consequence, they are not used. It is notable that both governments and NGOs tend to be unaware of this crucial issue &#8211; it is not, for example, mentioned in this paper. A great deal of money spent on textbooks is being wholly wasted on textbooks which may be efficiently supplied but unusable. In L2-medium education, for example in SSA, much more attention needs to be paid by education authorities and NGOs to the design of textbooks to make them usable by both teachers and learners.<\\/p>\\n"},"link":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/2016\\/01\\/19\\/how-we-could-triple-the-availability-of-textbooks\\/#comment-10731","status":"approved","type":"comment","author_avatar_urls":{"24":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=24&d=mm&r=g","48":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=48&d=mm&r=g","96":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=96&d=mm&r=g","128":"https:\\/\\/secure.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/14b07778ff73d8729d8720e1d80a7114?s=128&d=mm&r=g"},"meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments\\/10731"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"post_type":"post","href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/posts\\/6526"}],"children":[{"href":"https:\\/\\/world-education-blog.org\\/wp-json\\/wp\\/v2\\/comments?parent=10731"}]}},{"id":10721,"post":6526,"parent":0,"author":0,"author_name":"Hj Khairiltitov Zainuddin","author_url":"http:\\/\\/mytitovblog.wordpress.com","date":"2016-01-19T12:59:07","date_gmt":"2016-01-19T11:59:07","content":{"rendered":"<p>Textbook in Malaysia is provided free to all school pupils.

I do like and appreciate the idea of GEM. Most importantly, there is huge need for global level awareness amongst high level politicians like PMs and presidents, UN agencies&#8217; heads, development donors as well as social movement leaders about how to deliver quality basic education to all as their basic needs. How to establish education as equalizer rather than divider of society? How to stop commodification of education from local to global level &#8211; need for monitoring progress on these backbone issues. I expect this independent expert team not just to play around statistics and produce another global report, which does not show any direction. Democratization of education is very crucial, addressing inequalities through education is possible and imperative. It is high time to build robust public education campaigns in every country in the mode of social justice movements, only then can we connect it with SDGs.

This is really the need of the day. We educate but for what? For how long is yet another question. On the other hand, however much we educate the child keeping them in school for almost 13 years what do most of them get or benefit if they have to get back to the field and mange life in the traditional way. Hence why Marie desires  reforms or what we could call &#8211; &#8216;refolutionery&#8217; changes and reforms.  Some of the changes suggested are as follows<\\/p>\\n<p>The duration of the school universally is determined by someone for a specific period 12\\/13 years and primary to 5 years or so.Why not develop a curriculum and TT for a shorter period of duration which could be 4 years of primary and 5 year of secondary saving 3 to 4 years of wasting the time of the majority of children in the developing countries. Parents require them at the field sooner for them to be helpers,. A condensed curriculum would be equally strong to the task if the correct methodologies are followed. If more practical approaches are adopted to teach, which the children would be very happy (following  Paulo Freire&#8217;s pedagogical principles) This approach will save time, funds and be more realistic avoiding frustrations. Obviously we waste more money and time to bring about a few to succeed at the end of the day. No doubt the humanity needs the services of the brilliant but one should sacrifice the greater majority. Hence new strategies have to be identified. <\\/p>\\n<p>UNESCO has been promoting NFE and LLE as an option to teaching and learning and has spent time and funds to highlight the value of these options all over the world. These are highlighted in this volume as well. Hope the member countries would use these approaches to bring about quality learning, practically useful and avoiding frustrations amongst millions of children leading to achieve EFA goals with in the stipulated period.<br \\/>\\nS.B.

Monitoring is important and necessary for achieving quality assurance, but I think monitoring alone or by itself, is not enough for promoting education quality and future sustainable development.  If we want to ensure quality education that leads to sustainable development and life success for next future generation, we need to do more than one thing and each of us, whether you are a teacher or a parent, a leader or policy maker, a students or guardian, must be  all get involved and committed to education reform. <\\/p>\\n<p>The key is to  sustainable development is to ensure that from the time the child begins learning (formal or informal) training to the time one graduates or  drops out of school..they have acquired a certain level of hard and soft skills for survival.   So, in stead of  designing school curriculum, programs, or courses focusing on reading, writing, mathematics or accounting, training at all levels of education must engage and relate to changes in the world or life experiences to make it meaningful for students.  Traditionally, schools used to be seen as non-profit organizations because of their nature and interest in educating,  empowering and equipping people with knowledge and skills. <\\/p>\\n<p>However, as the world changes, the focus is much more put on making money rather than quality of service and student learning outcomes.  Increasing enrollment and getting more money is not bad,  but  the challenge of unemployment facing many  young people graduating from colleges is worsening.  out of 5 graduates 3 are jobless or underemployed.  We cannot solve this problem by using the same curriculum, instructions or culture used 20 years ago.
